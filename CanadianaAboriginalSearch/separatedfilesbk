We decorated them with tiny red hearts lef t froni last Valentine's Day. Then followed the making of the three chairs, the three'beds and lastly the three bears.

There bas been rnuch criticism of the course as laid down ini the Nature Leafiet. True, it is impossible to teach ail of these subjects, and this is as it sbould be, because if we bad a cut and dried course, and time t» drill the pupils, we should fail in the object of our teaching the subject, nameiy to keep up the interest of the child. It is good for the teacher to have it so. One who is to teach a lesson muet seek information and become acquainted with facts, go as to render ber capable of leading the pupils to discover these facts. As the pupils are to find out as much as possible themedves, to think, to observe, to investigate and to understand, this course cannot be taught through notes, yet notes must be kept of the experiments performed, and the kuowldg acquired, 80 that the child wM lrealiz he jepefrmn these for a definite purpose.

Supplying readtng matter te tuberculous returned soldiers in the military sanatoria is the. utilitarian end, but a valuable educational by-product for the children accrues. Froim old magazines and periodicals stornes, poems and jokes are clipped by the. children and pastid on stiff paper or sewn betwe\u003cen stiff paper cevers. The cost of these Ittle books is imfinitesimal yet they prove invaluable in the sanatoria, where more expensive books are apt te become se contaminated with the disease as te, have to be destroy- cd. The littde paper booklets can b. destroyed itbout lmu after they have been passed around among the patients. Little letters which have been pastcd into the books by the young biaders, giving their naine and addresses and expreshang the hope that the soldiers will enjoy the stories, have Icad te, intcrcsting correspondence between the men and the chldreu.
