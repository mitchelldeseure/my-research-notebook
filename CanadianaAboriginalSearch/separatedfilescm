         "Bar. THE PERFUME-HOLDER pROUD Naishapur, two hundred years ago, A Inviolate from the galling Turkish foe, Lite a warm opal dropped from Allah's hand, Lay ghmmenne on the green Khorassan land. Girdling the South, the desert's sandy coil Strangled the verdure and oppressed the soil; But East and North the languorous noon-day breeze Lifted the leaves of lime and tamarind trees Over the hills, within whose broken row The gleaming city watched the river flow. Along the camel track from Ispahan, Came tinklings of the nearing caravan, Trailing its parched, dust-cumbered passage down Into the market of the wealthy town. Piercing the vibrant ether, bold to view, A hundred minarets burned athwart the blue; The purple roofs of mosques, like sunset isles, Blazed all their panoply of porcelain tiles, While from the waUs the names of Allah shone In many a scrolled and squared device of stone Color and light loomed everywhere; their glow Burnished the booths and houses, row on row ; They flamed across the palace court-yard fla^ And blazoned even the cringing beggar's rags. The darkling ponds and fountains steely-cold The sun's keen alchemy changed to shimmering gold; And marble cupolas and awnings white Flashed forth all splendid with reflected light; While green pomegranate leaf and pregnant",

One ant-hke huge, conglomerate market made ' 5 t X Ca K '\"•\"I\"'' ''■™'\"\"\"8 vein, of iade. Yet the loud buzz of traffic even there Sjnk, at the high ^uezzin', cdl to prayer While so oppreMive grow, the blaze of day A li .u7 * \"^\"r, \"\"■■'\" »'\"^k the way. A little longer swirl, the bu,y bruit About the coffee stall, and booth, of fruit- A moment longer doe, the merchant stop, Uap^to the slender shutter, of hi, ,hop.

And silence settling o'er earth', fevered face Soothes for an hour the throbbing market-pkce. One man, a poor artificer in brass, btirs not as forth the hurrying vendors pass: But soon as quiet breathes along the street, bprmgs from his leathern cushion to his feet. Lays by the lantern he had shaped that day Uoks out along the cleared, deserted way. Take, down the bowl of rurds and loaf of bread That stand upon the slielf above his head, Hoob up a curtain o'er hi, small",
         "retreat THE PERFUME-HOLDER Which opens full upon the buiy ttreet, Cutt one more glance along the farther wall, Then hides himself behind the portal-shawl. One might have he-rd within that curtain 'oon A tapping througl the hot and quiet noon: A strange man this— mayhap for love of gain He worb mid-day when all for rest are fain? Such was his custom, and the passers by Had ceased to scan him with a rurious eye. The gossips had no tale of him to tell; They named him Selim the Unsociable. Too poor for note of even the idlest there Was he, and why he spent the hour of prayer Behind his curtain, save for rest and stiade, None knew or cared; few were that sought his trade. Twould seem such anxious privacy and heed Had little use; the street was bare, indeed. Save vagrant dogs that strewed the shining track, Like pious Moslems sleeping in a pack. Snarling in dream, because the heated bricb In poignant fancy smote them like the kicks Of Allah's Faithful — snapping jaws in pain, Then stretching out their quivering legs again. Who treads with silent pace the empty street. Then halts and hearkens to that hammer's beat? Well might you mark him by his furtive eye A friend to Falsehood, grasping, shrewd and sly. To Selim's booth he moves, — he makes a stand, The curtain raises with a stealthy hand And peers within ; the sudden shaft of light Flashes a marvelous work upon his sight; For lo, between the craftsman's bended knees, Prouder than aught that Shah or Sultan sees,' With lines of purest arabesque",

The spirit issuing through its portal flies To fairy realms of wonder and surmise- Such were indeed a taste of Paradise! Small thought of this had he, that sordid spy, Who on the masterpiece cast curious eye. He was a merchant, trained to every guile Of trade,— to fawn, to browbeat, and to smile; Careful to hold, in every scheme he tried Of fraud or rapine, law upon his side. His talon fingers in their craw'ing clutch Pulled forth the shadowinp ciruin overmuch. And Selim, of his presence made aware, Looked up and met jhe intruder's searching stare, And frowning, marked the sordid ruthless trace Of avarice on the man's ill^)mened face. Then spake the stranger with a smile compressed,- Selim, has Allah made the time of rest Too long, or given too brief a working day, That thus you toil the noontide hour away ?\" As some proud courser that with action grand losses aside a strange caressing hand. So Selira threw his head back at the word. For hateful to him was the voice he heard.

         "stayed. THE PERFUME-HOLDER A strident voice came, calling from afar The hour of work; at once the clattering jar Of hammers rose again athwart the air, The seething throng poured back into the fair, And through its alleys swirled the babbling flood. Like buzzing bees a-swarm within a wood. But Selim, through his resting hour intent And keenly active, languid now, was bent Above the brass-work, as though toil were grown Distasteful to him since the noon had flown. His hammer strokes, less eager, blow by blow. Dropped on the brass, grew slower, still more slow, And oft he clasped his brow and closed his eyes. Bruised by the coarse discordant market cries'; Then with a start, as if in self-disdain. Caught up the unfinished lantern once again. It was a hot and glaring afternoon; Through the bazaar the hum like a bassoon Surged constant; presently a clamorous throng Came, booming with the beat of drum and gong, While, blaring fitfully, the snorting blast Of trumpets on the scorching air was cast. The gathering scuff of many slippered feet Came now low-rustling down the dusty street. The loiterers left the shadow of the walls. Lured by the shouts and boisterous trumpet\u003calls. The hammer-smiths and chafferers paused as dashed The flaunting pageant forth and by them flashed. The last Shah's eldest son, 'twas bruited wide, Was riding to the mosque to pledge his bride;— Next to the Shah, the first of Persian land. And named The-Shadow-of-the-Sultans-Hand. A royal graft on humble stock whose sword Some daring day might make him Iran's",

         "booth; THE PERFUME-HOLDER And as she viewed the trembling rose of youth Throw signal on his cheek, she smiled, again Returned him salutation; now and then Loitered some moments at his little stall. And then with innocent art by letting fall Some comer of her veil, in hide-and-seek. Revealed the sweet curved vision of her cheek Of ripening olive, like the moon in mist, And rose-red lips half parting to be kissed. One day — one of those few thrice happy days That star perchance a lifetime — his amaze Burning his face, and hope still hopeless all. Rallying his heart to Love's unreasoning call — She came to visit Selim and to buy Some tii'.^kets of his patient industry. Lingering s;;» stayed an hour; she bade him tell The way he wrought the brass; with playful spell Now drew from him the use of lead and pitch; Then took the die and punch and bade him teach Her hand to cut the ductile metal through; One little die she held, 'twas, virgin new; A tiny whorl the pattern was; she tried To punch a strip of brass, while he, to hide Her slender fingers from an errant bl'iw. Shielded them with his ampler hand, and so As once the stroke she missed and still again, Still he rejoiced for her he suffered pain. At length she gave him back the die; he swore With words of fire, no one should use it more Except himself, nor he but on some gift For her; then she, her laughing eyes uplift To Selim's face, and with a doubting air Mocking his earnestness, yet told him where A kinsman dwelt, whose hand would duly take The present he might fashion for her",
         "sake. i \" THE PERFUME-HOLDER Then did her mood to childhke humor pass: Again she took a tiny shred of brass And twisting it with pincers in a ring Round Selim's finger tightly, tried to bring Mischievously, across the strong man's face A twinge of pain, and smiling left the place. And Selim, never from that hour at rest. Had shrined her lovely image in his breast; A few more times she passed his open door heekmg the market, but she smiled no more Upon him, though his eyes with hunger sued; That one brief meeting never was renewed. . Now his roused purpose to one issue ran: Upon that day he straight for her began A perfume-iiolder, lavishing his fond heart Upon It; for it eased him of his smart 1 0 feel he wrought her service, and to see Its beauty heightening— as some stately tree bpreads in the desert-when with the patterned whorl He would Its richly shining face impearl With tiny insets glimmering to the view, fashioned to let the writhing vapor through One name for her he had and only one: At each moon-end, his task more nearly done He muttered as with care he placed apart ' The gift, '■ 'Tis for The Star-of-Selim's Heart;\" The star that touched the wan, the lonely sky Of his rapt spirit, and then passed him by.

He hungered not, for the warm pulse of youth Fluttered his eyelids, b^at about his brain With visions blissful, rapt; for all his soul Vibrated, pinioned by the breath of June, Blown thru the cedarn alleys, and the burden Of swaying pine-tops melted thru his mood, Like incense midst a pure impassioned prayer. Till the deep diapason of the boughs Rhythmed the pulse of languorous delight With wordless chords of song. He came at eve Upon the woodland fringe, when camping Day Had set his crimson standard in the West, And driven his golden-maned steeds a-fteld For pasture ere the morrow; o'er the heath The opposing gradual shades of evening fell In folds like wings of sleep, and the mild dews Of Latraos, steeped in odors, filtered down Thru the dim breathless air and touched his brow With balm-anointing coolness;— o'er the vales Faintly the low of home-returning kine Rose with a hollow murmur, like the pipe Of Pan himself, and swathed the pulseless eve With a soft film of sound;— the purple shades Deepened to bluish jet, and one by one : ,",

Endymion drew His leopard skin around his graceful loins And leaned against a tree whose blossoms pale Broke foam-like o'er his head, and breathed their love Into the silent night; — the languid eve Pressed its nepenthe deep within his sou), Soothing with cool caress; his eyelids fell And his breast heaved with weariness; all cloyed With drowsy sweets he sank upon the sward, Arm-pillowed, dreamless in the pale starlight. But soon the curved moon from her cloud sphere Outbroke and turned her calm and tender gaze Upon the limp form of the Arcadian youth, Bathing with lucent glow his olive face And russet burnished limbs; — her nether horn Hung like an argent sickle, and from its tip A silvery gleam fell o'er the dusk-bound earth. Banding the height with lustre to the feet Of slumber-wrapped Endymion; — down its coil A radiant goddess slipped with arms outspread, White as the drift of Heaven; on her arched brow The moon had fixed her image, and her breast Shone brighter than Orion's belt with gems, That burned the dusk to splendor; at her back A sheaf of silver arrows crossed a bo\\' , The red hart's lordly tine; in her right hand She bore an ash-tree javelin tipped with steel, Wliich sooty Vulcan tempered diamond hard On Lemnos long agone; her beach-brown",

He nourished it with deftest skill And placed it on his window sill; A world of patient care, in sooth. He lavished on that new-born Truth. Enamored of its thrifty grace, He stood it in the market-place. And hourly to the crowd would cry, \"My precious Truth, who'll buy! who'll buy!\" He sang its praises late and soon In lyrics of all kinds of tune; Yet tho it shot forth green and fair. And spread its leaves to sun and air. Burgher and matron, maid and youth, Laughed at the poet and his Truth.

'Tis worthless, friend; you should devote Your care to matters less remote. Certainly God did not intend This unknown weed, to work His end. A thousand seedlings comelier far I'll lend you from my dogma jar. You surely cannot mean, forsooth. To call this wretched wild thing.

''X^WAS twilight hour; I sat in darkened mood; ■I. \"Would that the world would yield me more of good,\" I sadly mused, when, close at my right hand My guardian genius seemed to me to stand. His face was calm, compassionate, and mild. He gazed on me and all so sweetly smiled, A paly radiance strayed across the room, Like flickering moonbeams through a covert gloom. He placed his hand upon my bended head; \"Look up, my child,\" in pure, low tones he said; I looked, and wonderingly I gazed again. The room seemed filled with a triumphal train. Each figure in the dim light loomed and shaped, Then crossed and vanished where the shades were draped; And as they to my gazing passed away, My sweet-faced genius low tc me did say: \"These are the phantoms of thy youthful hope. They enter not within thy manhood's scope; Fair cherished ideals of life's early day, Lo, one by one, they slowly fade away. \"Look thou once morel\" again I raised mine eyes; There passed a figure clad in splendid guise; He eyed me with a shrewd, cold gaze of stealth; \"Not thine,\" the genius said, \"his name is Wealth.\"",

Sweeter than those e'er grown in Flora's bowers. Her eyes were lustrous as the stars of night. And graceful was her form as sylph of light; She held me spell-bound in delicious charm;' Sweetly she smiled and waved her lily arm. Yet passed she on— bewildered and amazed I earnestly within the darkness gazed ; The genius touched me, \"She too doth remove; Not thine,\" he said, \"men call this siren. Love.\" I heaved a sigh— with rapt look and profound, One slowly came, his head with bays was crowned; And fair as is the opening rose of morn, A changeful radiance from his form was 'borne. Yet simple was his garb— a glance he turned Upon my anxious eyes, that through me burned; With eager hps and outstretched hand his name I cried aloud, \"take all, but leave me Fame!\" Yet even as I spake he passed away; My head in anguish in my hands I lay; When a low voice upon the other side Said softly, \"Grieve not, I with thee abide!\"",

Would lure thy soul from higher destiny. \"Know thou thy good — what hallows mortal life Is 'gainst ourselves to wage a conquering strife; Learn thou of me thy frailties to subdue.

Your call to the children echoes to fill the battle line. t Far off the fisher hears it on the Banks of Newfoundland, The coasting trader hears it off Fundy's fog-bound strand, The lonely woodsman hears it on the rafts of Temiscaming, The call of the Mother in harness, \"Bring me your thou-sands — bring!\" We are coming, O Trident Wielder, we are coming ten thousand score; The seven-fold shield is lifted high on Valcartier's shore; The flag that tripped stem Cronje, the flag of a hundred fights. Is flying to-day for battle with the spirit of Queenstown Heights. To every shore of the British around the Seven Seas, The sons of the soil come trooping, their banners aslant the breeze; They will not fail you.

Angelo, the Immortal, found for thee a deeper note, and the magnificent Lorenzo gave thee added grace. Next, Surrey and Wyatt, twin.s of Enftiish rhyme, rescued thee from the neglect of Fame, and nourished thee on English ground. \"The gentle Spenser loved thee,\" and the high-born Sidney was thy servitor. But thy crowning gli^ry was to be the guest of Shakespeare, the Prince of Song. He took from thee thy Italian mantle and decked thee in his own royal robes. No man shall henceforth do thee ampler honor. Under the hand of the mighty Milton thou ob-tained an organ tone -thy note of Reverence and Prayer. But the degenerate children of EnglLsh Song abjured thee or gave but grudging habitation, until Wordsworth, Priest of Nature, ushered thee into his calm and stately cloisters. There thy plas'ic soul took on fresh harmonies and delights; new aspirations, fair hopes, sweet consolations and confldings. In thy turn thou becamest a teacher of menj and henceforth thou must remain the favored heir oi the English Muse. It behooves not to tell of all the illustrious masters who have taken thee to their hearts. The Old World still loves thy ordered walk, and the New has opened wide its doors and enriched thee. To each hast thou spoken in a different key, for thy nature ii variant as the flowers of mountain and field, of garden and forest. Thee, dwelling in the strict bonds of rhyme, I love best of all the Children of Song, for, if thou demandest much, thy favors are Imuntiful to them who worthily seek thee. But for them not of the true Brothcrhooil, wilt thou dig a pit-fall and cover the pretender and the careless wooer with shame. Therefore, O Sonnet, may my feet tread reverently in thy service, and in the name of these Masters be all this my cherishing of thee — so shalt thou obtain the larger honor r .id I perchance a favor more sweet. For my offering I bespeal' the good-will of all true votaries of the Muse, and of all others who worship and love her but have been holden from bringing gifts to her ahrine.

Scarce doth a vesper breathe, a ripple lave; Earth in her green, voluptuous garb of June, Faint o'er the verges of the wide lagoon.

WHITMAN In him, time-balanced mind and cosmic heart With common human speech were reconciled. Heed not the jargon tongue, the phrase defiled, The roughened hand, ignoring forms of art. Nay, from his breast what yearning sighs depart ! Hark how thuse vibrant tones grow pure and mild! While with the freeborn heart-beat of the Child His Earth-song rises and the echoes start.

Floats far the Dragon o'er the billow's creit ; Neath bellying sail his round world ked i\u003e pressed ; The Empire trade-wind through its cordage hums.

In arts, in arms, in princely feeling strong, Once more the dream of Poesy is thine! Thine is the latest Troubadour whose line From Ronsard runs in honor; of that throng King gleeman, who still wind their pipes along From towered Avignon to Camargue's blue brine. Mireio, of Death the dearest bride. Thy love and grief for aye, for aye are sung! The Homer of his cherished vineyard side, His heart e'er tender, bountiful, and young.
