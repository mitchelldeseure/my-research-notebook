Johnson, Fire Inspector, Board of Railw.ay Commissioners for Canada. The writer endeavored in the Jan- uary, 1916, issue of this journal to give a description and explain the proposed manner of using a system of portable gasoline pumping units de- signed by him and 'built for the Dom- inion Parks Branch for service in the TftlYininn Pnrks of Canada to be torest in slash bui ier theori of their timber by fire and are ious to provide up-to-date protec Put To The T'est. .One of the dlaims made for type of power pumping, appa was that it could be transported )noi into",

         "Caria dian Forestry Journal, January, 1917 five different methods of 'transport- ing the units. In addfition to these methods, a specially designed light7 truck on~ two wheels to be hauled either ,by hand or by horse, î1 has been designed and built and a t view of this truck appears in the January, 1916, issue of this Journa.] Along roads where it is possible for horse drawn vehicles to go, such1 method of transportation can also be used. Fighting Fires in Quebec. Another theory advanced was that such apparatus could be used to actually fight a forest fire. This theory lias keen p ut into practice and judging from the following extract from a latter received from Mr. Henry Sorgius, Manager of the St. Maurice P*ethod of carry1ng fie pump by two meni. Forest Protectwve Association prov-ed very successful: in the saving of fire-fighters' \"During the past season we wages and timber saved. On used the pumping outfit at four two occasions we used the pump different forest fires and it lias for three days, each lime fromn more than made up for its cost 3 a.m. until il p.m. only stop-",
         "899 Canadian Forestry Journal, January, 1917 ping when changingit, from place to place. We also used ità to extinguisha two other small fires. \"We generally transport the apparatus on1 our motor speeder to the point nearest -the fire, then the rest of the route is covered by canoe or by men on foot along the portages.

Are you aware that a white pine forest in Northern Europe is a thing of the past? The White Pine, from its original home in America was quickly introduced into Europe, be- cause of its great 1commercial use- fulness. But now there is no White Pine to speak of; it has been replaced by an inferior pi'ne. Why? A fungous disease is to blame. It appeared, worked for years in silence, nobody\" suspected anything wrong, and then trees began dying here and there--slowly at first, rapidly later on. Then the eyes of the people were opened too late, far too late, the disease was so firmly established. Then the 'governments realized the position, and plânted trees not sub- ject to this disease. They fought the disease; but like a vast fire the epidemic was beyond 'control. They eould dô uaught but look on.

During May and June, rareiy after the middle of June, the disease is mosat couspicuous on the pine. The formerly smooth dark green bark will be fouud swollen, puffed Up, \"blistered,\" and breaking through the bark wil be seen smaii whitish- orange scale-like bodies of a dusty floury appearance, composed of the spores or seeds of the disease.

In old pines the disease may live for ANOTHER STAGE OCCURS ON The fungus, as wask said, produced orange white dust-like a coloured flour. This dust, when viewed under a powerful microscope, is composed of thousands of minute grains, spores or, popularly, seeds of the fungus. These spores, like seeds of wheat or other plants, germinate in a similar way. But not in soul like the latter. They require living plant tissues to develop. These little organisms or plants, for they belong to the veget- able kingdom, are parasitic and live exclusively on living plant tissue, somewhat as the mistletoe in Europe grows upon and wîth its roots within the living apple tree or other tree. The s pores produced by the white pine blister rust cannot germinate on the pine direct, but pass the next stage of their if e history on another liost plant. When they faîl upon the leaves of wild or cultiv.ated currants or gooseberries, particularly the culti- vated black currant,1'hey germinate and produce on the lower surface of these leaves minute little spore blisters, from one to a few hundred on one leaf. These blisters are filled with brigbt orange-red spores, as small as those on the pine; to the naked eye years;ý young pines will succumb as SOQil as the main stem lias been girdled. Thus f ar, the disease on the pines. The symptoms should .be carefully borne in mînd, and always looked for, when one is in the woods in May and June. CURRANTS OR GOOSEBERRIESI This stage may appear on currants in the neighborhood of the pines from which the spores originally came, at aniy time from June throughout the rest of the season; thougli, later they produce a second kind of spores. The early summer spores spread the disease known in 'ths stage as currant rust; from currant leaf to leaf, shrub to shrub, planta- tion to plantation, and thus infection may travel for miles in districts where either wild or cultivated host lants occur. These plants are not 1 ed premature defoliation may resuit, with consequences injurious to 904",
         "Cancidian Forestry Journal, January, 1917 instance, the destruction of pines to 'save the currants, or, vice versa, of the currants to save the pines? These would certainly be the most efficient means to arrest this disease. The n'ext important lesson to be learned f rom the hlife history is the Imodes o! spreading o! the disease. It spreads o! its own accord on currants or gooseberries, for miles in one season, in ail directions;, and eventually reaches a pine, a pine plantation, or a forest, and these .then, in turn, may start new outbreaks. Hence the next lesson to be learned is this :-no currants or gooseberries near pines; no pines near gooseberries or currants. How f ar 1apart should these different host plants grow from ecd other? This point is still an open question-but the farther apart the better. Can this ýbe carried out? Sometimes a single pine, or a f ew pines menace théecultivated currants; sometimes a f ew shrubs o! the latter, the former. Therefore, whichever, in a given locality, is, the more in- p ortant must remain, and the other be destroyed--certaiily if affected, but better at any rate. Most im- portant o! ail, ail wîld currants and gooseberries should be destroyed: they are most serious offenders. This should be done everywhere in or near valuable pine woods. There, is yet another danger, that currant rust spores may adhere on baskets, o! currants 'or other fruit, when shipped from an infected areaà, and spread the trouble very widely- that the disease-will eventuaIly find its way to a pine. So f ar as now believed, currant bushes in themselves and sold as such, do not appear to carry the disease, once the leaves-are gone.' Doubt stili exists on this point, which we are now endeavouring to settie. Should the disease be con- veyed by infected currant bushes, this would constitute a new menace, and the question become more difficuit. However, it is generally held that in- fection o! currants occurs every year afresh from nearby pines, strange as this may seem.

But a portion of the same shipments was introduced into Cau~- ada. ln ail of these States, and also as far as Minnesota, the disease is 110W estabiished, as weil as in parts of Canada. It was first discovered in the year 1914, near Guelphi, Ontario, and later in other parts of the Niagara Peninsula, maînly on currants, but, uinfortuLnateiy, on native pines also. It is 110W dis- tributed generaily ini S o ut her n Ontario, but may not yet have reached the important white pine section, aithough no0 syste matie searcli has been possible there. Quite recently the currant rust stage was found in Ottawa; as it was also this season in certain localities of Quebec p rovince. Ver y urgent need exists ~or systematical inspection of ail pine areas. In the west no inspection lias yet been possible. It is gratifying to note aiso that both the Ontario and Quebec govern- ,ments have become deeply interested, and mucli work promises to be done next year. It wouid be a matter for congratulation if the government -in- spectors shouid be aided by, the employees of lumber companies and other concerus interested.

It is to be hoped that the matter deait 'with ini this article wiii be -fuily discussed at a meeting in, the near future, at which aIl interested parties may be represented. Co-operative effort alone will save the situation. Meanwhuie, if, as a resuit o! this article, attention and careful thouglit become focussed on its subject matter, something will have been accom- plished. In conclusion, I wish to auticipate the probable charge against me o! crying out \"wolf\" causeiessiy, and of taking too alarming a view of the situation. Let me most emphaticaily re-iterate, 1 am an alarmist, and am so of set conviction in this matter. My attitude is based on the ex- perience of other countries, with forest timber diseases, on the aiready rapid and insidious spread o! this particular disease in America, and lastly, but not ieast, on the import- ance o! rousing' to action ail con- cerned, wbile there is yet time.

'FOREST LANDS DEVOID 0F TIMB.ER, Heavy Inroads of -Past Fire\u0026s-Present Supply Ample However, For Great Development On November 23, Mr. Roland D. Craig addressed the Forestry Club, Ottawa, on the subject of the forests of British Columbia, w%ýhich lie treated from the physiographic and silvicul- tural standpoints. The province of British Columbia is approximately 740 miles from north to south and averages 400 miles in width, wîth a total area of about 250,000,000 acres. Running froni north to south ranges of mounitains divide the province physiographically into four main zones, which differ widely in regard to climate and silvi- cultural conditions. The warm, moisture-laden winds off the waters of the Japan current, in ascending the Pacifie siope of the Coast Range of mountains, produce an equable climate and cause a heavy precipita- tion which is conducive to luxuriant forest growth. To the eastward of the Coast range lie the broad interior plateaux where greater extremes of temperature and drier conditions pre- vail owing to the f act that the winds have been robbed of their moisture in passing over the coast mounitains. On the eastern side of the province another series of ranges, t he chief of which are,.the Rockies, again cause a large precipitation and another bet of heavy forests, resembling those on the coast, occur. The north eastern portion of the province, comprising approxiiuately one-eighth of the total area, lies to the east of the Rockies and belongs to the Great Plains, on which the forests- are of the sanie type a§ in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan. Froni nort1b to south these main zones may be sub-divîded following changes in dlimatic conditions due to differ-' ences in latitude and local topo- graphy. Bulk of T'imber on Coast Two-thirds of the total stand of the timber ini the province is on the coast, thougli the area is only one-quarter of the total. In the coast region for 150 miles north of the International boundary, and including most of .Vancouver Island, the forests are of the Douglas fir-cedar-hemlock type, with balsam, spruce, white pine and yellow cedar as secondary species. For the next 100 miles where the temperature is lower and the precipi- tation heavier, red cedar predominates, wi'th fir occurring only at the heads of the fiords which indent the coast and where the precipitation is lower. Associated with the red cedar are hemlock, balsam, spruce and yellow cedar. On the northern coast the following species occur in order of predominance: hemlock, spruce, red cedar, balsam and yellow cedar. Though confined to a comparatively narrow range on the coast, Douglas fir forms over thirty percent of the stand with red cedar .twenty-seven ~percent, hemlock twenty-four percent, balsam nine percent, spruce seven percent, yellow cedar two percent, white pine one-haif percent, and lodgepole pine and cottonwood one- haif percent. In the Interior Plateau region drier conditions permit a much wider dis- tribution of the Douglas fir which exteRds to the north of the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway and in the southern region western yellow pine and western larch are added to the forest species. Taking the interior forests as, a whole, spruce fornis over 40%/ with red cedar, balsam, fir, hemlock, lodgepole pine, yellow pine, Iarch, white pine and cottoniwood in \u003e 908'",
         "Canadian Forestry Journal,ý January, 1917 order of predomînance. The high percentage of spruce is due to its prevalénce in the northern interior and plains region. 60 Per Cent Waste Land 0f the 250 million acres of land in British Columbia, a very large per- centage of it, 60 percent, is estimated to be waste land from the standpoint of agriculture or forestry due either to its high altitude or to local site conditions. 0f the area which is capable of producing forests, Dot over 8 percent. has any agricultural value. Unfortunately, the forests on a greater part of this forest land have been destroyed by fire, only 35 percent of the forest land carrying stands of commercial value at present. These forests reproduce well naturally, and if protected from fire will supply wood crops aggregating many times the present cut of one billi'on feet per annum. It is estimated that of the, species suit able for the manu- acture of pulp this province can sup- ply 250 million cords. THE CHRISTMAS TREE TRADE la Government Regulation of Cutting Spruce and Balsamn for Decorative Purposes Practicable; the Children's Side Every year the Canadian ForeAtry Journal is in receipt of many letters from readers protesting against the ruthless cutting of young spruce and balsam trees for purposes of Christ- mas decoration. The Association in the past lias taken objection to the export of millions of these trees to United States purchasers excplaining that the Canadian farmner, from whom they were taken, was paid only a few cents each and the country was often a substantial loser in having so mucli young growth destroyed. It is beyond doubt that the cutting of Christmas trees becomes ini some cases an - act of vandalism as was recently reported from Hlamilton where hundreds of young spruces from a semi-public park were cut down and peddled about the city. That there is another side to the story is suggested by the following comments of Bristow Adams in \"Am- erican Forestry,\" and readers of the .tournal are invited to express an opinion as to how any Government regulation could lessen the waste of evergreens each year for these decor- ative uses, without clashing with an undoubtedly vigorous public senti- ment ready to resist the elimination Of the time-honored riglit to brigliten Chrnistmas day with a festive tree. \"Everv vear some one starts a cru- sade against the Christmas tree idea, and eve .ry year 1 wonder why they do not do the same thing against the Easter lily and the football-game chrysanthemum. In Michigan there is a nursery which grows Christmas trees as, a regular annual crop; in New England the farmers eut hundreds of thousands out of their fields for the city boys and girls, some of whom rarely get in any dloser toucb with trees than they do in this holiday season. Every year the dairy farm- ers in the hili counties of New York welcome the chance to, get rid of the spruces wbich work into their pas- tures and use up space that might be growing grass for the cows. The more our f amily lias thouglit about the use of Christmas trees, the more we have been ln favor of them.* \"One person says, \"let's ail do without Christmas trees; or, if we must have them, let every one plant two trees for the one that is used on Christmas.\" Now that miglit be a good idea in some few p laces. But how about the many children who live in tenements in the crowded parts of the cities? Are they to go with- out this one glimpse of greenness, or attempt to make two trees grow in a paved court-yard? Even in the large and elegant apartment houses the mighty janitor could not provide",
         "910 GaIaaîan îorestry Ju placesfor two trees for the childreu who live there. Oh, yes, there, are some apartment houses that take chiidreu. I've seen 'em! Then there are the chiidren on the farm, where father has brought in the home tree from the back pasture, and has sent John down to, the freight station, with forty bundles of trees. on the big sled. He is glad to have Sthat much 'more clearing done, and to have the work pay for itself. He wouldn't care, I am sure, to have a tree-planting baud go out and put in two new ontes. Besides, there is ail the trouble and expense of getting the two additional trees, and the very great risk that they will not live after they, are \u003eplant- ed would mak-e possible a loss of three trees instead of one. \u003c\"The best way is to have just as much or as littie Christmas tree as you wish, but not to try to make other folks do things your way. In many cases the merriness of the Christmas of the farm child depends on whether, there is a good sale for the trees that the farmer hauls to train or town. Iu any case, couid we get the opinion of the tree, it would, probably echo what one said in our discussion: \"If I were a tree I'd rather be used in makiug little childreu happy at Christ- mas than in any other way.\" The Christmas Tree Trade. It is most unfortunate from a con- servation staudpoint that Christmas requires the use of tens and teus of thousands of spruce and other ever- green trees, observes the Pulp and Paper Magazine. These trees are cut dowu and shipped out by the car load; the annual export making very serious iuroads on the future timber supply of the nation. A\\mong cattle men and farmers a movement has been started to put a stop to the killing of caîves for veal. It is pointed out that the present very serious shortage in daîry and beel cattle is largely due to the pernicious habit of slaughtering young calves. If a caîf is allowed to grow to ma- turity it plays a very much larger part in the economie life of the na- tion than if slaughtered shortly after birth. !LL 1 Tl\"r 101 In much the same way the cutting. down of young spruce trees affects our supply of puip wood. A man gets but a few cents for a Christmas tree yet it is ,probabiy cut from a hiliside which is incapable of grow- ing anything else but trees. The cutter neyer thinks, of replacinig the destroyed tree with a seedling and so the way is paved for the land to become a barren waste. If the tree is, left to mature and then cut and used to make paper the return, is much larger and with our growing apprecia- tion of the value of reforestation the probabilities are that a, seedling or two would be planted to take the place of the tree cut down. From the standpoint of the paper- men the Christmas tree trade, is most hurtful and we would like to see the Pulp) and Paper Association and the Commission -of Conservation take some action in the mnatter. Above ail others the cry of \"Wood- man spare that tree\" goes out,to the man who cuts, down, and ships out car loads of young spruce trees. Canada As a Paper Maker. Indications point to Canada as one of the most important pulp and- paper producers of the world for many years. There is no reason, except apathy respecting fire-protection in the pulp produciug regions, why Can- ada should not produce perpetually a large part of the world's paper. The large spruce forests in the east and uorth including the sub-arctic forest which has value chiefly for pulp, show Canada's capacity to grow suitable wood ini enormous quantities, suif icient, with auy kind of protec- tion and management, to supply the demand of ail time. Pulp forests are, however, particularly susceptible to fire, and need careful protection. It is gratifying to see that some o the most progressive pulp companws are successfully profecting their lands fr.om fire. On account of the com- paratively rapid growtli of pulp tim- b er to a commercial size it appears that pulp companies will be the first who can prove-that scientifie forest management is good business for a private concern.",

         "Canadian Forestry Journal, January, 1917 Free Cartoon Servic'e of Canadian Forestry As'soc. Although the interests of the farmn and the forest have been regarded in the past as more or less distinct and hostile, the broader outlook stimu- lated by the War has brought in- telligent Canadians to understand the woodsman and the agriculturist as close partners ini the great Canadian estate. More than sixty per cent. of the whole area of Canada is adapted by Nature for growing timber or held as permanent barrens and will not produce field crops prof itably. On this sixty per cent. no farmer desires an acre. At the saine time it ought to be producing revenues for the na- tion. As much of it as possible should be kept under frest groý.vth, producing wood crops regularly. This is the argument for \"forest conserva- tion\" in a nutshell. No one asks to be allowed to use agricultural lands -for tree growing. And no farmer will object if the country maintains non- agricultural lands in their natural money-making conditions, giving tim- ber harvests year by year. The Forest Dollar, therefore, is not earned at the expense of agriculture, but is the ally and supporter of agri- culture. Canada takes $200,000,000 a year from the forests and a very great part of this amount qoes to purchase farmi products. Until every destructive forest fire is stopped and every timber-growing area restored to its productive condition, Canada's agricultural interests must suifer the chief loss. 0f every hundred dollars that corne out of the forest, seventy- five dollars go for wages and supplies.

Dear Sir- We have followed with much interest and satisfaction the assurances giVýen during your recent campaign favoring theelimination of the patronage prin- ciple in Civil Service appointments and the *conduct ýof provincial aiffairs. m To the adoption of such a pinciple by all Canadian Governments, the Can- adian Forestry Associationphpas devoted no inconsiderable part of its educa- tional campaigns, and in successive conventions has pledged its support to the mewt system of appointment and promotion. In taking such a stand, the Association has been especially concerned for the welfare of the various forest services. It has been demonstrated be- yond argument that the qualities of skill, energy and devotion, absolutely requisite in a genuine system of forest guarding, are at a severe discount where the 'patronage' plan of appointmnents is in control. In Caiiada and the United States, extravagant and inefficient forest protection systems are to be found precisely where the patronage ýscheme has most freedom. In such instances the public pays heavy tolîs not for prevention of timber losses but to keep party followers in-well-paid idlenîess. The Forest Service of British Columbia has built up the best record of any forest service in the Dominion. The reduction of fire losses has been a direct consequence of good organization, close inspection, and a competent personnel. What has been accomplished in four years i a forerunner of even better results in timber saving during the years ahead.

Acres 'of desolatioli-the resuit of centuries of f orest abuse- abound on every hand. All Europe does not contain a more deplorable picture on s0 wholesale a scale. Reasons, for Neglect One wonders why forest destruction was allowed to continue for so Ion$ a time and on so gigantic and intensive» a scale, for it seems as if the ultimate outcome of such a process must have been foreseen. The writings of forest- ers as f ar back as the middle ages bear evidence that the significance of such a destructive tendency was compre- hended. They were, however, unable to accomplish much because political disturbances and ineficent manage- ment had impoverished the public' treasury, and the spiritof the people was antagonistic to anything which implied present sacrifice for future gain. Furthermore, the need of forest products-the real stimulant of forest conservation-was neyer keenly felt ini this sunny and penin- sular southland. The warrn climte and the absence of extensive .Wood- using industries reduced the demand for fuelwood and raw material of larger size, and accessibility by sea made the importation of needed wood material feasible. Not much material was needed; and the small amount which was required could be imported cheaper and easier than it could be raised at home. But these are only the primary causes for the present ~poor forests. Secondary destructive agencies became operative as soon as the forests had been opened up and partly removed, and have been con- ducting a destructive campaign ever since on such a wholesale and con- tinuous a scale that the resultant damage far sur passes that of the primiary causative factors. There are a large number of these secondary destructive agencies which in maiiy cases have impoverished the land almost, if not entirely, beyond re- demption. Fire, goats, erosion and floods, are the principal secondary malefactors, and a brief account of the nature and extent of their de- struction may serve as a valuable lesson to us in Amierica, now in the formative period of forest conser- vation. Heavy Fire Damage Wasteful' lumbering was followed by destructive forest fires which burned over the mountain siopes repeatedly. They were aided by the hot and dry climate and high winds; and, as a rule,' unhindered by man. Various govern- ing bodies passed laws pertaining to the prevention and extinguishing of forest fires, but were powerless to en- force them. The publie gave littie. attention to them because it was realized that the evil effect was de- ferred rather than ininediate. Upon these burnt-over areas there appeared a dense fire-coppice growth of brush, consisting of shrubs, many inferior, and a few valuable trees. 1This shrubby growth afforded ex- cellent pasture for goats, which the inhabitants considered more indis- pensable to their welf are than forests. Under such conditions the goat in- dustry naturally grew, but the forests disappeared; and 110w, in view of the damage already done, the goat is re- garded as the most destructive enemy of the forests of northern Italy and other nearby mountainous countries. They are present everywhere in large numbers. There is no city, village, hamlet, nor hardly a home or an acre of mountain land without them. According to a late census there are about 2,000,000 goats in Italy; that is, about one goat to every 16 inhabit- ants or about one goat to every 5 acres of forest land. As soon as the forest cover with its. absorbent carpet of leaf-litter is re- moved or destroyed, the fertile forest soil-the result of centuries of vege- table accumulation and rock disinte- gration-is exposed to the devastating influence ofrain and snow water. The process of erosion soon begins on a small scale and increases with eaclj successive ramn or snowf aIl, until practically ahl the productive soil has been removed and nothing remains except bare rocks, formîing abrupt cliffs or strewn over precipitous slopes. In summer these slopes assume a thirsty and parched appearance, and the rivers wbich they feed are but",

In springtime these samne siopes are the birthplace of raging torrents which burst forth with un- controllable force in the plains below, inundating fertile fields 9.\u003cnd deposit- ing enormous, quantities of detritus at undesirable places. There are more than 600 miles of artificial embank- ments along the Poe river, which meanders through a rich but almost treeless agricultural regioný after bursting forth fromn the mountains. A large number of -protective struc- tures exist aiong the Adige river, which flows through the center of the province of Trentino in which many ferce battles have recently been fouglit. Both of the contending armies have suiffered severely -from heavy rains and spring floods. Re- ports tell us that many groups of soldiers have lost their iives in cross- ing and recrossing this stream. when swolien and raging. In order to, ob- tain a .reai v ,ivid and iasting im- pression of this desolate region, one should approacli it from the north, that is, immediately after 'having ,spentsome time in the' intensiveiy managed and normaliy stocked forests of central Europe. 'In Beigium, France, Prussia', Russia and Galicia, the soidiers seek shelter' in woods, cover their batteries with branches and faggots, corduroy 'roads with poles, line their trenches with poles and props, and finish their subter- ranean c1hambers with sawed timber. The soldiers of the armies operating in the Tyrolean Alps are not so for- tunate. No wood is at their disposai, for they are Iocated in an almost forestiess region. Consequently they are compeiled to seek shelter amidst enormous rocks which cover the siopes and to drill chambers into the solid rock formations which crown coin- manding heights. .Un.der such con- ditions the contending armies cannot do much damage to the forest growth, but they arc certainiy making the task of the future reforestation more diffi- cuit. The present damage may not be so great, but the ultimate, and in many cases irreparable loss wiil be feit by many subsequent generations. Italy's Tree Assets One must not conclude from the foregoing description that Italy is treeless. It lias many valuable trees, but most of themn occur in orchards and parks, on estates and Iawns, and along streets and boundary limes. There are in Italy about 2,000,000 acres in olive groves, and 400,00 acres in chestnut'orchards, and thousands of mulberry trees which support the silkworm industry. The lemon in- dustry holds a prominent place about the subalpine lakes, because of the superior fruit produced. An enor- mous number of trees are also re- quired to supply props for, the vine- yards which cover almost nine mil- lion acres. The Italian governiment has not been unimindful of the need of forest conservation and restoration. Num- erous protective and constructive iaws'have been enacted, but littie was accomplished until about 1877. Since then the land lias been ciassi- fied and protection forests have been established on the higher mountain siopes. Special inducements are given to individuals and communities who reforest mountain land.' In 1902 it was decided to. celebrate a \"Feast of Trees\" (la festa degli ableri), copied after Arbor Day of the United States. OnMardi 31, 1902, the city of Rome heid the, first celebration in the presence of the »king -and the queen, plantiiag about 10 acres with 1trees.

This prolonged political unrest may be at least a partial explanation for the present unsatisfactory forest conditions. Tire forests of the 'other countries of-,southern Europe, most of them 110oW at war, are not exactly like those, described but they have many points in common. They are, as -a rule, poorly stocked and mismanaged. A general perspective may be obtained -by classifying them under two head- ings, viz.: wood importing and WoQd exporting countries. Wood Importing, Wood Exporting, Italy, Servia, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Turkey. Roumania, Bulgaria. All the above-named wood import- ing countries, except Servi, have a small forest area per capita of popula- tion. Servia has a total forest area of 3,750,000 acres, about 37 per cent. of which is classified as state forest land. In spîte of this large forest area con- siderably more wood is imported than exported. This is due to the unor- ganized condition of forest utilization. .Roumania and Bulgaria, the only countries whose exports exceed un- -ports, have forest areas of 6,250,000 and 7,570,000 acres respectively. In both ceuntries the hardwood, chiefly oaks, beech, elm and walnut in the southern part of Bulgari a, comprise more than 75 per cent. of the~ forest area. These extensive and unex- ploited forests are a valuable asset and will become more valuable as recon- struction progresses after the war. The consequent Ioss, however, wilI be enormous and 'the damage in in- numerable cases irrparable. J. S. ILLICK. From \"Among The Trees.\"ý Ye have no history.

         "Canadian Forestry Journal, January, 1917 Ihe Ancient Cedars of Lebanon By Guy E. Mitchell The great Cedars of Lebanon are among .the most interesting living records of the past. The grove which is standing to-day is the remnant ofthe saine forest fromn which the cedars were cut and hewn for the building of the Temple, at Jerusalem by Solomon. There are many re- ferences to the Cedars of Lebanon in the Old Testament, the most notable in ýFirst Kings, where it is stated that through the cooperation of Hiram, the Ring of Tyre, Solom'on brought great, rafts of cedar from Lebanon to Joppa and carried them up the steep mountain-sides to Jerusalem for the, first temple. In the building -of the second temple, under Ezra and Nehemiah, the tim- bers were procured fromn the sanie cedar forest on the slopes of Mount Lebanon. 'At an earlier period the Psalmist refers to the Cedars as the ornament of Lebanon and one *of the great glories of God's creative power and wisdom. Pliny, the Greek naturalist, named the svecies Cedrus magna, meaning '\"great.' The impressive thing about this, ancient grove of cedars is the know- ledge that the oldest and largest of them were undoubtedly living at the time when the timbers of their im- mediate predecessors supported the Temple. They are upwards of 2000 years old, not so old as the great Sequoias of our Pacific Coast, but stili very ancient. At present there are only about 400 trees lef t, ail very large and old. The best preserved are about 100 feet higli and one lias a circumference of 47 feet. The grove is now protected by a weil-built, higli atone walI; but all the balance of the great cedar forest of Lebanon lias succumbed to the greed of man, and the grove stands like an oasis in the desert. - I considering the otherwise ab- solute destruction of thie forest over the entire mountain-side, one cannot help but wonder why this group has been preserved. A probable explanation is found ini the namne of the stream at the foot of the moun- tain-the Kadisha-which rises in the moraine left by the great glacier which swept down from the summit of Lebanon and on which the Cedars of Lebanon throve during early I3iblical times. This word is the Hebrew for \"holy\" and the grove, has undoubtedly been preserved because of its sacred character. The..,natives to-day. will tell you that the grove is sacred because it \"was planted by Jesus Christ,\"-a belief which -finds the semblance of justification from a poetical passage in the lO4th Psalm referring to \"the Cedars of Lebanon which the Lord hias planted.\" A 's the trav\\eler stands on the sum- mit of Lebanon, nçarly 10,000 feet high, and looks down upon this ancient gxove, the remnant of a mighty forest, and upon! the still more ancienit glacial moraine upon which it grew, and sees upon the flank of Lebanon the ruins of ancient temples and the vast expanse of the Mediterranean beyond, and to the east the distant ruins of Syrian Baalbek, hie may recaîl the force of the words of Holy Writ, \"all flesh is grass and as thé flower of the field it perisheth.\" Over this expanse, witnessed by theseý trees and their immediate predecessors, have, corne and gone aIl the great nations of antiquity. Here are the relics of the Assyrian, the Babylonian, the Egyp- tian, the Phoenician, the Greek, t he Roman, the MQslem, but yesterday, as it seemns, the Crusader, and now the warring. Turk and Slav.

It means, too, that the famn- illes going into 'Northern Ontario to settle can depend in future upon prac- tical protection against such calami- ties, and so feel encouraged to under- take the task of settling in the new country. Undoubtedly the preven- tion of forest fires wilI have the double effect of saving timber and giving a stimulus to .settlement. A great source of difficulty ini the gMat lias been the confliet of interests etween timber owners, settiers, and prospectors, together with the in- ability of the individual settler to pro- tect himself against the carelessness of others. This can novu be entirely donc away with. The time of year at which the Minister lias made lis announcement is a fortunate one, because between now and the next danger season in the summer of 1917 there will be time enougli to arrange details and a ppoint the uecessary staff to put te system into effect suifficiently to reduce greatly and j robably almost eliminate the fire osses that we could otherwise prediet with certainty for next year.\" Paper Suspensions. Eight hundred country newspapers have suspended in the United States since the price of news print paper began advancing, according to a statement made before the California Press Association. Asking The Settiers' Help. The ingenuity of some of the north- ern f ire rangers in the prairie provinces, in working up publicity schem-ý es to aid f ire prevention lias often received a deserved testimony. The Association recently received a unique book of photographs fashioned be-ý tween bircli barkcovers, and with typewritten text graphically describ- ing the case for forest protection. It was the work of Jas. T. Blackford, Chief Fire Ranger of the Dominion Forestry Brandi at Norway flouse, Manitoba., The only means of access to the country ,patrolled by Mr. Blackford and hsmen is by steam- boat, and the book was placed on a table of the steamer so that hundreds of travellers com~ing in and out read it through. On the cover are the words: \"Manitoba North Pire Rang- ing District, Patriotie Slogan: 'No Pires in 1916.' It is hoped that sucli happy ideas will be put into practice elsewhere. Lightning Hits Chestnuts. Lightning shows'a marked prefer- ence for chestnut trees, according to data based on reports submitted to the U.S. Departmeitt of Porestry by its foresters. 0f a total of about 2,000 trees struck by lightning on the State. Forests ini the p ast four years, 655 were chestnut. Pitch pine comes next with 327 trees struck, and then follow in order rock oakj white pine, hemlock, red oak, white oak, black oak, locust, and sugar maple. Black bircli is at the foot of the list with only one tree struck in four years. Poplar and walnut' corne next, only two of each being struck.",
         "Canadian Forestry Journdl, January, 1917 1,000 NEW MEMBERS JOINED IN 1916 Suçcessful Ending to Twelve-Months' Effort in Building up Strength of the Canadian Forestry Association The goal of 1000 new members for the Canadian Forestry Association in the twelve months of 1916 bas been reached. After a membership campaign car- ried on by the office of the Associa- tion during the year, stimulated from time to time by special appeals to the old members, the final fifty of the thousand arrived after the month of December had come perilously near its close. The total membership is now 4350, which represents an increase of 50 per cent. during the last two years. The period in which this growth bas taken place has been most unpro- pitious to the development of any society or movement . not directly linked to the War. The promise of a much greater development after the declaration of peace is, therefore, very encouraging. The distribution of the member- ship is approximately as .follows: Ontario 1300; Quebec 800; Prairie Provinces 900; British Columbia 500; New Brunswick and Nova Scotia 500; United States and British Dominions 300. There are also 200 newspaper editors who are Special Members of the Association, not being subject to fees. The increase in membership, as noted, does not, of course, take account of any but paying members. The Association also sends packets of free copies of the Journal to Mili- tary Hospitals, Convalescent Homes, reading camps in the woods, camps of the forestry battalions etc., and to mpny prospective members thus brmging the total circulation of the monthly to 4700 copies. While the great majority of mem- bers have no business connection motives of good citizenship and a personal interest in the beauty and utility of flourishing woodlands from the standpoint of camper, fisherman, hunter, etc., it has been a gratifying circumstance that during 1916 a large number of lumber, and pulp and paper firms, their officials and senior em- ployees, became linked to the Fores- try Association. Their assurances of interest in the work have been most hearty. The loss in old members during 1916 was notably small. There were some cancellations of membership by death, a few by change of residence and inability of postal authorities to learn the new address, but fewèr than fifteen in a total of over 4000 ¯have voluntarily resigned. It is intended that the Canadian Forestry Journal which has developed during the past eighteen months from 16 to 48 pages shall be further en- larged and much improved in point of appearance and contents. To the many members who have given the Association splendid sup- port in developing our numerical strength the Secretary wishes to ex- press his hearty thanks. 400 Acres Planted. Director of Forestry R. H. Camp- bell recently visited the Laurentide Company, Limited, plantations at Grand'mere, Quebec. There are about 400 acres of plantations all the way from one year to four years old. These consist of Norway Spruce and Scotch Pine in mixture; Scotch Pine; White Pine, and Norway Pine in mix- ture; and Norway Spruce in pure stand. The NorwaySpruce has also been planted in the open under the shelter of White Birch and, Poplar,",
         "Canadian Forestry- Journal, January, 1917 and'also, underplanted on land which has been logged over. The planta- tions are doing very well-the l'oss in Norway Spruce being less than one per cent, and ,ail of the plantations are now 'beginning to show up in first class shape. A visit was also pad to'a lumbering operation on land which had, been heavily cut over for soft wood, the remaining stand con- sisting of large Hemlock and hard wood, mostly White and Yellow Birch, and Maple, and small Spruce, Balsam and Cedar. Practically ail of the hardwood has been remioved so as to give an opportunity for the soft wood reproduction to take place, and, where this has failed, planting operations will be begun next Spring. Fire lines have been cut, and ail the brush. eut from them, and in cases operations have been burnt, and this has left the ground in good shape, and is a good example of what can be done along these lines. Mr. Campbell ex- pressed hiniseif as welI pleased wvith the Laurentide Company's opera- tions. Wood Wharves vs. Concrete. The Port Commission of Seattle, Wash., of which J. R. West is ehief engineer, in answer to criticism on the use of timber and pile construc- ,tion in the Sea'ttle wharves, has re- plied that wharves and freight sheds such as have been built by the port will have a life of probably from 20 to, 25 years, which is also about the econoxnically useful life of such a structure. The Commnission addg that condi- tions of water transportation are con- stantly changing, and this will render terminal structures obsolete after a certain number of years, this period being on-the average about 25 years. It has not been demonstrated that concrete made of Portland cernent is permanent in sait water. If it does not prove to be permanent, then the added cost is not in any way justi- fied, and if it does prove permanent then the physical life of a wharf wouid exceed its useful life, which is not economical. Another argument In favor of the cheaper creosoted pile and timber construction which is particularly true of Seattle, says the Commission, is that a given amount of money ean be made to produce more terminal facilities to invite new business than could be provided if the more ex- pensive type of construction had beiin adopted. L Keep WOoolots Clear of' Animais I One of the most Important steps to be taken in the care of the woodlot is its protection fromn fire and ani- mals. Fire should neyer bc allowed to run through it, for not only does this destroy seedling trees and injure large ones, but it aiso destroys the litter and vegetable matter on the ground and leaves the soul exposed to the drying influence of the sun and wind. Pasturing animais in the woodlot is a great hindrance to the proper development. Cattle, ini addition to eating off the tops of small trees, destroy the undergrowth and thus ailow the sun to act on the soil and grass and weeds to establish them- selves. The resuit is the larger trees begin to slowly die at the top and decay sets in. In woodlots that have in the past been negiected and now contaîn many more or less open and grassy spots it may be advisable to pasture hW for a time in the fail. These animais by rootîng about stir up the soit and put it in good condition to receive the seeds when they fait from the trees and thus a new growth of youné trees is started.-B. R. Morton, B3. Se.

         "Caniadian FoÈeslry Journal,' January, 1917 British Forësters in the Cameroons j The following letter has been re- ceived, from Mr. A. H. IJnwin who is ini the British Forestry Service in Nigeria, Africa. Mr. Unwin was for- mýerly ini the Dominion Forestry Ser- vice, and is a member -of'the Can- adian Society of Forest Engineers. The letter is as follows: \"In Nigeria I arn in charge of the Working Plans Division, but since I came back this time 1 have been transferred to the British Sphere of the Cameroons (late German Colony) to report on the plantations and forests as well a s the Agricultural resources. Needless to say the Southern Forests, such as I have seen of them, are grand with plenty of Mahogany of various kinds, besides Ebony, rubber and bullet wood, also ironwood. Most of the land is reaily covered with forest, except for the small clearings of the natives here and there. The Ger- mans had not developed the timber industry in this part very mueh; in fact- compared to Nigeria, they had been very slow in taking up Forestry and only had six men in all, 'compared to Nigeria's sixteen at th saine date. They had, however, done a certain amnount of planting at the District Stations, -chiefly with Teak, rubber Cocoa, Indian blackwood, as well as what they called German Steamer. I cannot quite make out what they meant by this. They had planned to plant in the drier regions away f rom the Coast; but littie had been done before the war. Now we will hope they will not be allowed to return. Several large rivers for floating logs are found both North and South, notably the Cross River and the Mungo, as well as four other rather smailer onies, the Akwayefe, Ndian, Moko and Meme.

The known species of timber trees regardless of shrub trees in this part is about 300, quite apart from the unnamed trees.

Ail bird loyers will rejoice to kniow that a treaty has been entered into betweeu the United States and Great Britain to protect migratory birds in this country and Canada. By three great highways the birds and the waterfowl pass back and forth be- tween the' two countries. One is along our Eastern Atlantic coast, an-, other is by way of the land included in the Mississippi valley, the other is the Pacific slope west of the Rocky Mountains. There is also a north- ern, or breeding zone, and a southern, or wintering zone. While in passage, and while in the north or in the south our migratory insectivorous birds will have the protection of both govern- ments, the game birds also will be protected under laws and regulations agreed upon.

At the- recent 'election the people of New York State voted to tax them- selves $10,000,000 for the purchase ýof forest preserves. The f act that this was not done by act of legisiatuire, but by a referendum, shows how popular the idea of state forests bas become with the people at large, says \"American Forestry.\" The for-ý est preserves of New York are not .only of great economxic importance for the preservation of the water supply and of local industries, but serve as an immensepark which is visited annually by millions of people. 0f the total amnount voted. $7,500,000 will be available for further purchases in the Adirondacks and Catskills, where the State owns already 1,814,- 550 acres of forests and lakes, and $2,500,000 for the Highlands of the Hudson Preserve. A private sub- scription of a like sum had already been secured contingent on the passage of this proposition of the referendum. There wilI, therefore, be available altogether $5,000,000 for the comn- pletion of a great interstate park in the Highlands of the Hudson.

         "Canadian Forestry Journal, January, 1917 Fuel Value of Wood vs. Coal The fuel value of 2 pounds of wood is roughly equivalent to that of 1 pound of coal. This is given as the resuit of certain calculations now being made in the Forest Service laboratory, which s how also about how many cords of certain kinds of wood are required to obtain an amn- ounit of heat equal to that in a ton of coal. Certain kinds of wood, such as hickory, oak, beech,- birch, bard ma- ple, ash, elm, Iocust, longleaf pine, and cherry, have faîrly high heat values and only one cord of seasoned wood -of these species is required to equal one ton of good coal. It takes a cord and a halfý of short- leaf pine, hemlock, redgum, Douglas fir, sycamore, and soft maple to equal a ton of coal, and two cords of cedar, redwood, poplar, catalpa, Norway pine, cypress, basswood, spruce and white pine. Equal weights of dry, non-resinous Woods, however, are' said to have practically the same heatvalue re- gardless 'of species, -and 'as a' con- sequence it can be stated as-a gen- eral proposition that the heavier the Wood the more heat to the cord. Weight for weight, however, there is very littie difference between various species; the average heat for all that have been calculated is 4,600 calories, or heart units, per kilo gram. A kilo- gram -of .resin will develop 9,400 heat units, or about twice the average for wood. As a conselquence, resinous woods have a greater heat value per pound than non-resinous woods, and this increased value varies, of course, with the resin content. The available heat value of a cord A WELL EQU'IPPED LIBRARY Think what it means to be able to have within reach the latest informa- tion relating to forestry and allied subjects.

The two methods employed were, stump pulling by power, and removal by dynamite. A stump puller of the drum and long lever type was employed, giving a lifting power of 25 tons witli an ordinary tearn. With one hundred and twenty stumps, 10 inclies and over to the acre, and seventy-two smaller stumps, it required an average of twenty minutes with a team and driver and two men to remove each of the large stuimps and 5 minutes to remove each of the smaller oiies.

Any area of slash miay he declared a public nuisance, if it endangers life and property, and the operator in such cases is required to make it safe, either by burning or by con- structing a fire line.

A pulp or paper miii can not be taken down like a portable saw-mill and moved from one place to another as the supply of timber is exhausted, millions of capital are invested and oniy b y long termi operation can it be made to pay. 1 do not wish to be taken for au alarmist and 1 arn far from pessimistic but 1 do think it is time for us to stop guessing about the amount of timber we have, and to face the facts, mnake a careful inventory and utilize our forests inteiligently. My own conclusions are based on facts, care- fully ascertained. Why Costs Increase. The question of accessibility of wood supplies plays *an important role in the cost of raw material, in the case of wood, the extra expense of- taking men into the woods long dis- tances, of transporting provisions first by rail then by sleighs and the long drives on the rivers all add to the cost per ton of paper. This diffi- cuity lias been aggravated by our rnetliods of logging. At first ail the timber was cut ,off around the lakes and along the rivers for say a half a mile and this was gradually extended until the liaul became too long to be economically possible. Also timber in difficult places was left. The usual method of logging which is still in force nearly everywliere in Quebec is to let e contract in a predetermined district to a jobber for' a certain num- ber-4of thousand logs. The number of logs that can bcecut is guessed at as the timber ieft is the most diffic uit to get out a higlier price must be paid. Unfortunately, until within -the iast six years the river drivers in- variably set fire to the slashings in the spring and burnt off the timber, so that one could not go back at ail. The course of practically every driv- able stream is burnt and I estimate that about 30 p. c. of the St. Maurice Valley has been burnt over in the last fifty years and about 16 p. c. of this area has not yet commenced to reproduce and the balance wiil not produce a crop for many years. Composition of Forests. The condition of the forests is a matter about which the average man does not have any very clear ideas. In the first place we have -very littie forest which is composed of just one species. In swampy places we have pure stands of black spruce, growing thickly, hardly ever attaining a larger size than ten inclies and most of the trees of great age owing to the un- favorable conditions of growth. 1 have often seen trees five inches in diameter over one liundred years old. Then on sandy plains we have dense stands of jack pine which has usually corne up after a fire and which is s0 crowded that the trees are very tali and spindling and will neyer reacli commercial size. On large areas too, over which fire lias passed we have stands of aspen and wlhite birch neither of which trees growing under such conditions have mucli merchant- able value as they seldomn reach large size, are generally diseased and com- paratively short lived. Our really good forests are composed generally of balsarn 61 p. c., white birch 17 P.C., white spruce 15 P.C., black spruce 4 p.c., maple 2 P.C., cedar .5 p.c., other hardwoods .45 P.C. and white pine .05 p.c. 0f this about 32 P.C. of the total stand spruce and balsamn can bceuct above tlie Gov- erniment diameter limit. The way the cutting lias been carried on*in the past most of. the white and black spruce and some of the balsamn has been taken off. Where a good deal of liglit lias been let in and conditions were otherwise favorable the balsam lias corne up in dense groups in which",
         "Canadian Forestry Journal, January, 1917 the struggle for existence is s0 great that the trees rapidly become dis- eased and the resulting stand is of small value. Where the conditions are more favorable for hardwood re- production these trees seed in thickly and make it very difficult to obtain reproduction of softwoods. Our pres- ent methods of cuttings are slowly but surely turning our forests from coniferous to hardwood ones and the coniferous will have a difficult time to re-assert their supremacy over the broad leaved trees. We are leaving the whole matter to chance and un- questionably our forests are deterior- ating. The leaving of the debris from lumnbering not only increases the P.

This May mean that More trees must be left than under the present systemn' with a slight increase in present logging ex- penses but a large decrease the ex- pense in future operatiolis. In chang- ing over from an unreguIated to a regulated forest the expenises for log- ging wiîll be larger for the first felling but thereafter should gradually de- erease as the stand of mierchantable timber increases. We also want to utilize every pos- sible tree. At present we .have a large amount of hardwood which is left in the woods and as 1 have said before hinders the growth of the' coniferous trees. It is quite possible to use this for pulp with the soda or suiphate processes but 1 understand that it cannot be utilized with. the sulphite process. 1 visited a Miill in Austria which used beech entirely and made a good quality of pulp. There is, it seems to me, no reason why hardwood should 'not be used for ground wood; the fibre is, of course, shorter, but it ought to make a good filler.

This would lengthen the time «ver which our supply of spruce and balsam w,,ould last and add much to the value of our timber limits.

Then there is the elimination of Iogging wastes which are at present larger than they should be. The lumber companies usually take logs from a tree until a diameter of six inches is reached but the pulp coin- p anies, take down to four inches. Hlowever, a very bad custom stili holds of using logs thirteen a»d one hall feet long and as it is often im- possible to get a log that length out of a tree, top much good wood is wasted. We have measured up over two thousand tops and we find, that in the St. Maurice Valley about 31,- *000 cords of wood are wasted each",
