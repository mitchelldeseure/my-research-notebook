But what the war lias gained for Cainada in the inspiring of a free people, In diseovering to ourselves lthe higli quality of our common cday, is greater than ail te eost, wheiJher of treasur-e or of human lives.

There- fore, the coud uct of that army abroad, no inattor what its teruperamentai peculiarities befere It gees Into deadly action, was that of an heroic force.

We cannot tell what the final harvest of war will amount to, but with the dead, the diseaaed, and the disabled, it will probably run into ten figures-more tban fIve timea the measure of human sacrifice de- manded by ail the great wars that shook the world from Blenheim. to Omdurman. Even these mons- trous figures do flot tell the whole tale, for there will be among the dead thouaands of men whose talent inigbt have developed into genius, and there will be bundreds of thousands of widows le! t in the full flush of womanhood, witb ail their possibilities un- fulifilled and, in countless cases, beyond the reach of fulfilment. To put it brutally, our civilizatiofi, that stands ln bitter need of its best breeding stock, bas deiiberately slaughtered a very large percentage or it. This, indeed, is race suicide ln ita worst form; and just as woman hopesý by hier emancipation ta dam the tide of war, so she muet step into the breach and dam the tide of loss. Emancipation will do very litile for women If wheu tbey have obtained It they find the best elements of the white races in- creasingly unable to stand the strain imposed by war. They will not forget that the black man's wamen are bought ta tend bis land and enable him ta live in ease, or that the Mobammedan, ln the enforced seclusion of the harem, may share his favours among four* lawtul wives anid as many con- cubines as bis purse can tu.rniah. As the standard of civilizatiail declines, woman, by reaison of hier physical weakness, muet pay an ever-increasillg penalty; only wben it bas risen ta heights un- reached before the war naay she hope ta came into lier awn and ta realize ambitions that, dormant or active, have been with hier tbrough the centuries. The wbole question of ber future has been brought by the war outside the domain ot persanal or even national interest; suddenly it has become racial.

It la nat toa much ta say ibat civilizatian as we know It wil soion be waiting upon bier verdict.

We reprint this musical item just as it appeared in a Toronto news- paper: \"When the first breath of Spring was wafted on the stili, cbilly air there ap-ý peared a new musician on the city streets. He appeared. to be a vencr- able old man, very feeble and stoolied w1th age. His trembling fingers and grey locks mnade bim an object o! gen- eral compassion, and bis daiily con- certs on the' street corners In the downtown district invariably attracted a large crowd. \"Interest in this odd and almost piti- fui figure of a street musician was heigbtened by the unusual instrument on wbicb be earned bis livellbood.

In some manner the constable became suspicions of the genulneness of the aged musiclan and on S.aturday afternoon took bim. in custody on a charge of vagrancy. The mani walked witb faltering steps into Agnes Street Station, and tben in a second became transformed.

Allowing generously for ail requirements that urgency justifies, however, there stili remains a large volume of our imports that come within the non -essentiai or undesirable class, a fact which indicates that national econ- omy ls not as great a It ought te be. We are assured, however, that the Can- adian West a In a splendid position. George Munro, president of the western section o! the Canadian Banl\u003cers' Associ- ation, says that business o! the banks with the farjners In the West was neyer In better shape. Loans are lower and de- posits higher than ever before in history.

He had JUît returned from St. Enoch's, the village near whlch the mail-cart driver had found the body of Wilson Poîgleaze lu the irnaîl heurs. The articles 'whldi lie liad examlnod wlth such careful scrutlny were thoso which he liud remnoved from the dead man's pockets-a number of coins of the realm, a watcli and chain, a well- filled cigar case, a whlskey flaslr and a letter.

This dld nlot In the least shake the testimony of the doctor, who beld that tbe deceased bad been pulled from bis car and then rnurderously assaulteïl. It only suggested that the rnurdered man had put up a more or legs vigorous defence before finally succurnbing to bis assailant. After the brave show they made durlng the performance of the Super- intendent's uncongenial task there came the inevitable reaction, and Hilda and Mrs. Pengarvan wept In cacb other's arms.
