GILSON, D.S.O., Commanding Ist British Columbia Battalion. DEAR CoLoNEl, GizSON, The LISTENING POST, through menit, lias outgrown the local anid prescribed functionis of a Regimental journal, and even of a Brigade Publi- cation. It'is known and read not only throughout the Western Canadian Inifantry Brigade, but circulates widely in Canada. Witli your kind permissioni, 1 wisli to convey through the ineditini of the LiSTÊEN1NG PosT Firsi, a message fromn every mnember of the Western Canadian Infantry Brigade to anixious hearts at homne, to assure them that tiey have our constant love and de- votion, our daily tholits, and our wishes for a Merry anid HaPpyv Christmas. Keep the Home Fires burning. KeP Our places in your hecarts and in our homes fresh and fragrant, for th ouLgi lonz years and long leagues separate us, our love and loyalty know no space of tiine 1 Tir distance. Second, a mcssage tc Officer and Man of inv sioned l 1 arn their deaths With pride and joy, and we know that their souls go marching with us. We know that the spirit of devotion that anhnated them remains with us, and we feel that the enemy lias 'no battalions, no gas, guns, sheils, nor'bombs which will dampen or deter this spirit of deterination-the Canadian Spirit. XVe remember, when we first came to France, the Men usually sang on the mardi. But for saine time .back marches are mostly made in silence. We have listened to the metallic \"clack, clack\" of our Men mar.ching in regular cadence on the pavé of the Grandes Routes Nationales ; to the '\u003ccrunch, cruncli\" of their feet on the metalled roads; to the sof t \"tamp, tanip\" on the'cday lanes ; to the 'stick, stick\" on the sticky and slippery miud, and to their mardi in single file over shell-holes and grassy tracks when on their way to the trenches. We, have heard them go by in their tliousands-and silent. Why is this? What are the Men thinking about? Has their enthusiasni diininished? Is the spirit changed? No! The Old Spirit is withi themn as strong as ever. Their faces in the sunlight, their shadowy forms in the moonliglit, if you watch them, will tell you this. Trhe swing of their bodies and the souind of their feet speak of confidence and determination. It is three years, over, since tie F irst Canadian Con- tingent sailed away fromn Canada, and they now march silently over the roads and lanes of France and Flanders because their thouL2hts are of Homes and Loved Ones far een youir yoii ail a o to the r themn, the Western A LETTE R PROM BRIG.-GEN.

         "Special -Chrisimas Number. THE LISTENING POST. December 1 i 1917. 1914. IN a prosperous mining, town ini the nortb of France there stands a large, quiet-looking brick building; one built for comfort and not for looks, and yet attractive on account of its very plainness and peace- fixlness. It stands Well back from the road and a little above its neighbours on the siope of the bili-side, adding effect to the sinall but well-kept garden and winding drive- way leadinz up to the front entrance. From here, if you look towards the north, you will see a maze of littie, red-tiled roofs snuggling cozily in the valley below-all regular in size and shape, yet each a home in itself, the home of some hard-working miner. In the distance, as if to offset so mucb brigbt colour, a peaceful hill-side greets the eye with its fields of yellow and green dotted, bere and there, with trees. But let us g-lance inside to a still more peaceful scene, along the broad, tiled liallway and into the inany large, well-lit rooms, fitted witb every convenience, with their pretty wall-papers, bigh, decorated ceilings and beauitif-ul furniture. One room will strike you as especially cosy and bome-like, for it is the sitting-room. Here,, at a valuable old desk beneatb the window, a pretty girl sâits gazing dreamily through the window at the peaceful scenc outside, with a balf-flnished letter before b er. On the other side of the room, in two large arm-chaîrs drawn up close to a cheery-looking :fire, are two, prosperouis looking, well filled-out beings--Pa and Ma. Outside in the hall- way you can bear the coy, little servant girls tripping up and down as they prepare the evening meal. Such is the scene of happiness and comfort, 'a scenie so commonplace and 'natural that no wonder it was taken for granted-and war, well, what difference could war muake ? 1917. The'old'bouse still stands--or part of it-for three years' war bas surely left its mark. The trim-looking garden is now a mass of sheli -holes, with here and there a littie patch of grass and weeds to show where the smooth lawn used to be. Round the bouse, itself a mass of bricks, débris lies strewn, f allen from the shattered and shell-torn walls and roof. Inside, too, the change is-even more pronounced, for the plasterless walls and ceilings; and the paneless windows, and damaged flors-long'since looted of tbeir furniture-strîke the eye painfully. Down below, where Fritz bas been and gone, you find a honey- comb of stuffy dug-outs. Vet, perbaps, what strikes one most of ail is the change in the occupants, for now the old brick bouse is the holder of the proud title, \"Battalion Headquarters.\" In place of those peaceful, quiet-lived folk you find a noi.Sý hustling mob. In that pretty, spotless hallway a hungry buncb of signallers now sit and dine in state; while a powerful smell of ',whizz-bangs à la Foreman\" fills the air., That: quaint, cosy sitting-room now bas an awesome, digni'fied appearance, for between its strengthened, sand- bagged walls sits the Major-playing cards. In the base- mnent, wbere those pretty, modest little maidens beld full sway, you will find-alas! a noisy gang of well-fed, bat- men; wbile Iower stili, the orderly roomi, that confusingz mass of' papers, wires and maps, wbere the Adjutant sits and tears bis ýhair. It's a sad change, and even tbe view is not the same, for views of desolate ruins witb \"minnies\" landing in the distance, and five-point-nine shrapnel bur-sting overhead, soon lpse their charnm. 'Ves, if bricks could talk, I guess that same old brick Îiouse could tell a tale to beat the warriors of the Second Battie of Ypres--and that's going some, believe me., JIMMY. fý1 -~",

There are'only threc classes of people pronerly entitled to the use of the proolx «\"WTe\" in conversation-i. e., Kings, Editors, and men with tape-worins. Bonscoif, though neither'a King nor an Editor, was distinctly enl- titled to this editorial privilege. Hie was always hunigry.

So hie hurriedly made lis way to the Sergeant-Maior's dug-out, wbere lie unceremioniously elbowed his way well to the front of the littie crowd of expectant recipients of, mail and par- cels which had gathered in obedielice to thie magie cali. On arriving there, he wý,as somewhat surprised to hear- the well-known voice of his S.M., \u003c'Old Bill,\" raised iu suiphurous strafe of the Saniitary Corporal, who was ex- plaining, witli onlly a sligliy lesser degree of heat, that lie had ecaned ail the trenches and dug-outs, and had buried the refuse of bis Comipany that very morning, and that furthermnore, there were no dead Fritzes lying around that lie knew of. \"But d--- it ail, man,\" roared Old Bill, \"cau't you smell it?\" \"Sure, I can suteil -something, but I'mi hanged if I know wliat it is,\" assented the harassed Sanitary Cor- poral. \"Perhaps somecthing lias crawled into youir dug- ont and di2d,\"-he suggestedl, hopefully. The indigniant repiy was iuterrupted at titis stage by the hungry Bon- scoif, who) had spotted a parcel addressed to huin lying on top of the nlewly eîniptied mail, saying eagerly, \"Say, Sarg-e, how's ch-ances to gît iny parcel now? JIm for workinig party to-niglit.\"1 \"0(-o-o-o-o, biess you and your parcel too ; take it and get ont VI said the polite S.M\\., and Bonscoif obeyed the double order with, for hinm, unusual promiptniess, and lie was soon legging it down tlie trencli in tlie direction of Iiis dug-ouit witli bis precions parcel under bis ami, \"Funnyv,\" said the Sainitary Corporal, \"it dlon't smieil so stroug o \" Nýext to eating, Bonscoif best loved a gamne of \"Black Jack,\" so it is not sn.rprsing that tlie sounds of \"Hit it aud take it'\" emiergin'g fromi a nleiglibourinig dug-ouit sliould have lured hiim into its murky dcptlis.

By the time the fish course was served, and several bottles of champagne, I was calling the Honourable Gwendolyn by lier Christian name, and we were talking as thougli we had been friends ail our lives. \u003c'She asked me to tell lier about the front, and how many Germans I liad killed, and I told lier about the time I cieared a dug-out of fifteen Fritzes and took them prisoners- -but niaybe you fellows don't rernember that ?\" \"Wé certainly don't,\" we shouted. \"'Ail ýight:, don't get mad.

And during the niglit the remnants of our O.C.'s band did again dig mnany ditdhles and await what might befaîl on the morrow. 113.

We are corne to figit ; will ye not comle out from your hiding-places and figlit witli us ?\" And they did pile their arims and lay do'wn their equipmnent and their kits to test awhule. 119. But Fritz, the enemny, had seen them froin afar of, nd of a suddexn did shoot off many cannon-baîls, so thtsome aingst them were slain as they mocked. and mucli fear from the spot, for tliey liked not this kind of fighting. 120. And then did the hirelings of our O.C.'s band corne fromn their holçs in the ground and did select from the kits of the departed onles many articles both of equip- ment and of apparel and robes in whicli to sleep, for they wete in sore need to replace theit losses in the battie., 121. -And when the depatted -ones did return with diffidence to the scene of their boasting, there was mucli waîling and gnashing of teetli, for there ivas left of their fine equipmnents but a remnnant. ý 122.

On the moruing of this memnorable day 1 had been doing mnost of the work and was nearly ail in, but when the General sliouted, \"Orderly ! \" I answered, \"Sir ?\" immie- diately, and was in front of hlmn in a second. \u003c'Wlat's your namie?\" lie asked. \"McCbook,, sir,\" I answered. \u003c\"Webl, McCloolk,\" lie said, \"I want yon to take this important message throughi the barrage to the front line by four o'clock,\" and lie handed me a bulky parcel. I could see by the way lie handled i.t that it was soine- thing of great importance, and that, being a judge Qf men, lie could tell that I was tp be trusted. 1 looked at my watch. It was three-forty, pip emm-a, and 1 had eight miles to go. I grabbed miy steel lîd and gaspirator, and, jumping on mny trusty wheel, sped away. Thirtyi, forty, fifty, sixty miles an hour I went. Sooni I reaclied the zone of fire : shebis burst arouud mie and gbanced off miy steel helmnet, but stibi on I flew. Presently there came a flash and a roar, and soiuething seemed to give, but owing to miy terrific speed I was two kiboietres farther on before I noticed that both wheels hiad been blown away. Was I down-hearted? No! Was I dismayed? No ! Brushing aside a five-point-. niine, whidh Fritz sniped at me, I ruslied te one of our batteries nearby and shouted for a horse. The Major was very sorry, but lie said lie had nothing but caterpiblars. Now I kniew lie was kiddirng ine-becatise caterpilla.rs are those woolly things yon go into the .garden to eat when your dame goes back on you. Ilowever, I. had no timie -to fool with mere majors.

Oh, boys, that was some ride! Ini a few seconds, 1 was level with the front line, so I dropped off in front of the O.C.'s dlug-ou~t .

The second in command of the estaminet, lier one obsession seemed to be speed. She flitted in and ont of the capacious lounge, where wTe sat and waited for the refreshmnents that were-if Madame was to, be believed, and lier rapid-fire actions to be correctly i 'nterpreted-to be spread before us on the instant. We simply could not keep our eyes away from lier. We were cold, and we were wet, and we were liungry after a long hike in drizziing ramn; and we were impatient to dally with the cup that cheers, even thougli it does inebriate, as welI as to partake of something in thie nature of 'solid nourishment. When we made known our wants to Madame, on our arrivai, after mucli struggling mith the language of the L.and of the Fleur de Lys, it was as thougli a heavy load had been taken off our'minds to hear lier reassuring and comforting \",toot sweet \"1; and so we settied back to enjoy ourselves to the uttermost franc. Out to the kitcei liurried Madame, then back to the bar, thence to the kitchen, thence to the bar, alwavs on the double and neyer forgettiflg the cheering \"toot sweet\" in passing. We were thirsty, and tired, and hungry, and feeling anythîng but comfy in our damp ciothes in thu fireiess room, but it was lice a voicL f roi heaveil itsei every few seconds to hear that cheery \"toot sweet.\" And s0 we waited-and waited, and waited ! The minutes passed, and stîli Mladamre dashed in and ont, \",toot sweeting\" as she rustled by witli full steami ahead. .Now, when you are feeling down in the mouth arýd th. inner man needs a lot of bracing, conversation, even to the liînited extent of \"toot sweet,\" begins to, paîl on one's weakened system. Wliat we required was'food and drink, and thien we could have cut loose on the talk. Speed on the part of Madame in getting about the estaminet was, ail very weli in its, way, but wliat wu wanted was, a speeding up in the supply of foods and iiquids ; and there was none. We were patient, like unto job, but even patience lias its limit. The minutes lengthened into an hour and ail we got was \"toot sweet. \" It 'was unsatisfying and discouraging.

From the bottoma of my heart I ask you-is it ? And so, as the minutes of the second hour rolled along, we began to think nasty things of the gentleman who flrst invented the expression, \".toot sweet\"; and from him our tlioughts turned on his forefathers, and ail lis progeny, and then on to, the race that used this, now, to us, hideous phrase. We thought unprintable things, and our wrath boiled up in us, so that, in some instances, we actually lad to express them in good, plain, Anglo-Saxon, thougli, of course, being officers-and temporary gentie- mien-this outpouring of our overburdened minds came only in the few odd moments when Madame was not flitting tîrougli our midst. These moments were few and far between, for, despite ail the darkening looks and the chilly atmosphere of intolerance that steadily settled over the assembled company, Madame was not in the 1eaet dis- couraged. She still breezed in, and still breezed out, and stili had lier smile and dhirp. Just when the party was almost unanimous in deciding that it was \"toot sweet\" to move on to other and more hopeful estaminets, there was a wild iurmoil in the direc- tion of the kitdhen. It was as thougli the neiglibours had gathered for an investigation of the proceedings, and had at the outset declared themistlIves totally at variance with everything and everybody. Shrill voices wevcre heard in a tumultuous clamour ; dishes and pans rattled with a terrifie clatter, and the uproar was fearful and awe-inspiring. And then the great event happened: through the door from. the kitchet bounced Madame, her girlish smile enlarged to a riotous grin, and again burst forth that hideorus \"toot sweet?.\" As one man we rose in protest, and as one man we started for the door. And then Madame abanldoned her \"toot sweet\" sniping, and launched, forth with a volley of words that had us reeling, in our weakened state, on the instant. We hesitated, and that momientary lesitation proved our salvation ; for fromi the kitchen burst forth Madamie's mother, the commander-mn-chief of the estaminet, and ail lier kitdhen help, bearing trays and plates, and other things that betokened our wants were to le satisfied at last. 'rhere was no mistake : it -was \"toot sweet\" foo~d and drink in abundance. After our weary vigil it looked and tasted so good that we forgave MUadame, then and there, for ail false encouragement of the previous hour and a hlf. Tired nature simply lad to capitulate with that wealth of good things in siglit, and without a furtlier word of protest we resigned ourselves to the pleasant task of eniovinz ourselves to the full. we want no more \"toot sweet.'\" adli an estaminet again, we are going a the first sonnd of that mudli ab )we are going to move without an_ oever. irbe we will an~d mnavbe we wqxi't. -e that famnous day, when first w 2d\" almost to the point of despera 1 other estaminets-estaminets withc J ail kinds, big estaminets and snu ones and dirty ones, and warm ones ive tried themn ail, and somne of theni Whien we to be guni-shy, ased \"tou-t-dfe- V loss of time \"1toot have ber- mnets, ones. you, dear other of ether you we write, Murphy's Letter.

THE surplus material in war is sucb that special men are detailed for the work of collecting arins, equipment, and stores left lying round -in trenches, billets, and along the roads in the' vicinit'y of the lînes. This work is called \"Salvaging.\" To the average civilian the word \"Salvage\" conveys littie or no meaning, but to the \"ýTommy\" it recaîls nuany experiences, pleasant and otherwise. There is an art in salvaging, and to, the Battalion is given the distinction of once possessing the slickest (if not in appearance) and most successful salvage man in the Corps, to whom we will refer in this story as \"«R.\" Every time the Battalion moved to a new locality it took no mdre than twenty-four hours for notices to ap- pear in front of every door, or place wbere the door usually is, \"NoT TO BE SAISVMED. \" These notices proved that R. was on to lis job, and that people had already realîsed that to lecave their surplus stuif arouind Was fatal. We didn't mind him lifting the other f ellows' stuif, because our \"Salvage returns\" brought umpteen con- gratulatory messages from the people biglier up, and as, after ail, we are only human, we like that kinid of thing. Unfortunately, as 1 will explain, we have re- ceived our last '\u003cpat on Uic back\" in the mnatter of Salvage Returns. Last time in the trenches, R., on looking round, de- cided on the left sector as his sphere of activities. The first night in, the sentries heard suspicious noises in somne ruined holûses in No Man's Land. A patrol was sent out, and, surrounding a house from which noises were issuing, succeeded ini captilring-not a Hun-but R., who cuirsed the Corporal for rushing in and making him lose couint of the JIun rifles he was getting ready for removal. The Corporal was very wroth, but fnished Up by assisting in remnovîng the salvage to the front line. After that, R. pursued bis occupation unmolested. 'Ihe trenches in front of themi, behind them, on the para- pet-mn fact, every coniceivable place was stripped of its aIl in the way of salvage. Every night the O.C. I4eft Sector rubbed bis hands together and gloated- over the ever increasing salvage list. The nigbt before the relief, R., producing a long list of salvage, applied to the O.C. L.,ft Sector for an extra large carrying-party, explaining that as the relief was to take place next night, it was absolutely essential. to get everything out imînediately. The party was des- patcbed to, the rear, and with it a note calling the Cololiel's attention to, the good salvage work done in'the Left Sector, and recommending R. for special considera- tion. Next day an officer and N.C.O. from the relieving bat- talion arrived at the O.C.'s dug-out to ge 't the necessary information with regard to the sector, and to take overý stores. After making the necessary explanations, be produced the Trench Stores List for signature. In spite of the assurances that the stores were complete, in good condition, and in a saf e place, tbe incoming officer sug- gested that he would like to look over tbem for himself. bhey arrived at the trench store depot, lifted the ground- sheet which took, the place of a door, and looked in. The O.C. ruibbed his eyes and stood speechLss-the place was absolutely e mpty. Suddenly hio begani to see ligbt. He called for the last niight's salvage list and comparedý it with bis, list of trench stores. Good heavens ! He bad provided the large working-party to remove bis own trench stores, and there could be no relief made'until tbe stores were retu.rned. He fell in thie bottom of the trench in a dead faint. A moment later tbe bewbiskered face of, R. appeared round the traverse, and, taking tbe situation in in a glance, he hastily donned bis equipment and made down the trench. ýA sentry reported getting a flectîng glimpse of a man in full mrarching order going uip the commiunication-trench towards the rear at somne- thing more than a double. R. bias not been seen since, but rumour bas it tlhat be is witb Brigade, but always remains in a duep cellar witb the door barricaded when ho bears of the approach of tbe Battalion. L. G.O0.

M DICAL Officers, sanitary men and'others, have been ûtterly taken'aback by the eagerness, even zest, with which troops in' the forward areas have latterly undertaken dug-out dlean- ing operations in compléte, inversion of their usual atti- tude of deep distaste for this style of flghting. The necessity of appointing parties of men for these humble duties, and of watching them do it, lias sinply ceased to exist. Officers cannot believe their eyes; N.C.O.'s wander *about with an air of disconsolate amazement. Prom ail quarters we hiear the question asked, \"Why this sudden virtue ?\" It has fallen to the lot of dug-out journalism once again to point the moral and adforn the tale. Several. days ago the staff of a certain headquarters wereobliged to inove on account of shelling. Their niew stand was a very frowsy affair, littered with ail sorts of rubbish and broken fuirniture. Ihbe snb-staff were at once ordered to clear up. After a period of sour contem- plation of a job which didn't intrigue them worthi a cent they got to work. In the course of moving an ancient mnattress one of the boys heard a sound which struck a faint answering echo fromi out of the limbo of thiings half-forgotten-it was a noise like mnoney. Instant scrui- tiny and frenzied searcli brouglit to, light three hundred francs of indisputable, honest-to-God kale, in gold. Fromn that hour the troops have developed a passion for cleaning np which shows no sigu of abatemeut, and has led more than one Exalted Person to wonder if the premises on which lie based lis estimate of the characteristies of the tioops were true or not. Time will tell ! Later a groupr of transport men were seen to order an astonishingly large number of penny beers. Trhat they had undersold the market was evident by the fact that one of'their'number on asking for vin blanc was voted down at once, as that would have involved spending another barrelý. It is hoped that the publicity given to this incident will act in future as a deterrent to unscrup)ulous pro- fiteers and a warning to hoarders. REMARKABLE RELIGIOUS REVIVAL. Scores of Soldier Pilgrians. Extraordinary Enthusiaum (F'rom OUT OWnt Tarnle RUînoourist.) T lias long been believed by a certain section of thé Ipublic that soldiers are an irreligious lot, anld that even the immninenice of death within the trench- zone lias f ailed to breathe Iif e into the dry boues of the formnai durch parade. That such a belief is hiasty and superficial has been proved by the recent wonderful spontaneous deepening of interest in religions mnatters when it becamne known that leave to visit Lourdes would be granted. When the announicemient was flrst miade the already over-worked orderly room staff were reduced to despair by the inrush of applications, but mnanfuLlly they strove ta bring order out of chaos. One uinusual aspect of this remarkable renewal of spiritual if e ini the battalion was the fact that, on examin- ation, it became evident that ail creeds and sects alike were anious to make the pilgrimage. Presbyterian, Anglican, Romran, Christian Scientist, Unitarian, al unanimously declared their deshre to visit Lourdes. And the Padre beained. It beçame the one topie of conversation. A crowning proof of the absorption of the battalion ini this questior, was the fact that, for a lime, it even eohipsed the more,-, ancient and time-worn matters of discussion in the Q.M. stores mness.

When I left Eugland I joined a party of siglit-seers about to tour France under the guidance of a conductor whose manuers, by the way, were sometimes offeusively brusque and autocratic. I had hoped to, go to the Riviera first, but the guide iusisted that we should see the beau- ties of Northern France-a course for which, in the light of later experience, I caunot condeflit him.
