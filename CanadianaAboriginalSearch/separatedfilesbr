R. Marsh in the Economic World. He tabulates bis figures in the above table whicb makes no pretence to exact accuracy. It is, bie says, doubtless hundreds and perhaps thousands of mil ions out Of the way in\u003e respect of the varîous items-the depreciation of the market value of the perpetual annuity indebtedness, above referred to, would have the effect of greatly diminishing the present true capital of the ante-bellumn debts. while beyond question the figures of the war indebtedness are far too small, if accounit be taken of the vast obligations enitered into by the belligerent nations, but not yet funded. \"Then, to0, it mnust be remnembered,\" says the writer, \"that a very large proportion of the ante-bellum indýebted- ness represents the cost of economically self-supporting state enterprises. For example. the cost of almnost aIl the railroad lines of Europe (outsîde Great Britain) is covered by these public obligations; so, too, are the telegrapli and telephone lines (including those of Great Britain). But the essential point, after ahl, is that the great war has occasioned in a single year an ascertainable 'increase of the public debts of the European nations, directly or col- laterally affected by it, of not far from $î7,ooo,ooo,000. As the present cost of the war is running at the rate of nearly, if not quite, $2,ooo,ooo,ooo\u003e a montb, it would appear that by July, 1916, if the war endures so long, the war debt of the European countries will have attained the enormous sum of over $30,0oo,ooo,o00 and the total public indebtedness the stupendous 'amount of perhaps $70,ooo,ooo,ooo, or more than the total wealth of any country in the world' except the United' States, Great Britain and Germany. \"It is the contemplation of these unheard of and, in- deed, neyier before dreamed of figures that rwakes the",

They endeavor to estimate the ann'ual interest alone that must be paid upon the inconceivable sum.-total and they get some sucli resuit as this: Interest on ante-beIîurn debts (allowance being made for 'self-supportilng State properties), 3 per cent. On $28,ooo,ooo,oo, or $4, ooo,ooo; war debts already incurred during the first year of the war, 5 per cent. on $i7,ooo,ooo,ooo, or $5,o ooo; war debts to be incurred during the ensuing Year of war, 6 per cent. on $24,ooo,00oooo, or $,4,0,-, a totality of interest alone of $3,I3,ooo0\u003eo00; and they recall that the aggregate annual national s'avings of no two of the major belligerents together (omitting increases of land values, which in this case do not count) have ever so far as we know, reached this gigantic amount.

Nations WÎIl Sustainthe Burden. \"Nqone the less, it is our own contention that the European nations can and will Sustaini the burden, that they are (with possibly one or two minor exceptions) in n0 danger whatever of becoming bankrupt, and that general repudiation of their indebtedness is the last thing that need be feared. We believe, further, that the very magnitude of this suddenly piled-up national indebtedness wÎll give rise, as soon as the war itself is disposed of, t, an unparalleled forward leap of industry and commerce flot only in the countries which have been engaged in thé' war, but ail over the world. \"For instance, the quarter Century following the war will, we are confident, be marked by a vast and swift eConomic developmnent of the hitherto scarcely touched waste places of the earth, with aIl the reaction of this uipon, the great industrial and commercial nations, such as could not possîbly have been *brought about by an un- burdened and comfortable world in less than a Century of slow saving and creeping advance. We are fully aware that at first sight and for persons unaccustoied to carry through to the distant end the analysisof such uitterly unreal and bewildering phenomena as we have here Vo deal with, this statement must appear not merely startling but wholly incredible and contrary Vo reason. What Is a National Debt? \"The first step is to analyze a littie more closely than is customarily done, even by professed economiats, ex- actly what a national war debt is, wliat is the manner of its genesis, and what it really represents after it has been incurd. lit, is usual, of course, to look upon lit as any other debt is looked upon, i. e., capital borrowed at somne rate of interest, and which ultimately inust be repaid, principal and interest. In fact, it is common to think of it as something fair less defensible, from an economic point of view, than an ordinary comnmercial 'debt, inas.. much as the very purpose of the borrowing is waste of that which I~s procured by the borrQwed meaiis. Hence the common saying that a war debt signifies just s0 nluch capital destroyed and the world the poorer by sc: much. \"That this is fallaCious rcasoning, however, is shown by the obvious fact that all but an cxceedingly small part of what a nation's armies use up in the course of a year would have been uscd ýup in any case and would have left wtation at peace w\u003c) .ng, the boots and s] part of the aIrnlui a multitude of othe belligerent nation p And the using up lot be a waste of C2 of in this connect\u003c ,uld have to be looP 3iere is some waste c *would be foolish er te Of capital èOmIrn expenditures of the a whit less foolish. war debts do ,n in als ai illusi viien in( irses, A ý5.oo of -_ A gets ourse, a rmediari the use te, this, d worn îts and ýes and 'ther, an various imed The n of",

         "THE MXONETýARY' TIXES Vlm 5 SERIAL PAYMENT PLAN FAVORED Expert in Municipal Finance Cites Strong Arguments Against Sinking Fund Method Strongly favoring the serial payment plan for municipal financing, Mr. Howard F. Beebe writes in the Trust Comn- pany's Magazine, saying that hie may not be charged with having arrived at this opinion without having given due con- sideration to the sinking fund method. Mr. Beebe, who is manager of 'the municipal department'of Harris, Forbes and Company, and was one of the committeýe of three bankers appointed to make recommendations to the finance committee of the New York ýState constitutional convention, makes the following statement: G;iven a mathematically correct annual or semi-annual appropriation, invest it promptly with the periodical increment at the exact percentage which the muni- cîpality paid for the money borrowed by the issuance'of bonds, there is no advantage in the serial* payment, the resuits being exactly the samne. So much for the theory, whîch for many practical reasons cannot be worked out to that end. invsstment, of Slnklng Funda. Assuming that a city selîs an issue of 5o-year 4Y2 per cent, bonds on a 4Y4 per cent. basis, it will bie necessary that each anýnual payment to the sinking fund bie received promptly when due and with interest on the accumulated sinking fund- for the previous year be invested on the day it is received at 4Y4 per cent. to attain the resuit of paying off the samne issue of bonds by the serial method. Further- more, unless the securities in which the accumulated funds are invested are of as high grade as the issue to be retired, there is the element of risk, however small, to be considered. That the investment of a .sinking fund in the manner de- scribed above, could not be accomplished year after year will be readily acknowledged by any one familiar with such matters. It may bie argued by someý that the returu on such a sinking fund might bie above 43/ per cent. and thereby benefit the city. This, of course, is possible, but the proba- bilities are that it would be at a lesser rate.- What. actually happens in a large majority of cases îs that the annual pay- ments are delayed, that they lie uninvested (except at a comparatively low rate of interest), ini the local bank de- positories for some time. And, furthermore, through an attempt to get as large a return as possible securities are often purchased which are of a grade inferior to the bonds which the fund is to ultimately pay off; or that there 'may be no question as to the safety of the moneys, the irnvest- ments are somnetimes mnade in such a materîally higher grade of bonds as to preclude the-possibility of realizing as hi gh a net return as the bond issue itself cost the munici- pality. W7hen a bond issue matures it is necessary that the sinking funid, for this purpose, in its entirety shaîl bie in cash. It is, of course, impossible to arr:ange each investment to mature at the Eýxact time the rnoney is needed to pay off the maturing,.bonds, so that often, as pointed out above, the money lies in the bank for a considerable period at a nominal rate of interest. î,nxporience 0f Municipal Officais., Unfortunately there is still another phase of this sub- ýject whîch must be-considered: Municipal officiais, as ýa.class -duç to their.lack of previous training and inexperience- -cannot be commended for either ,their intelligence in the, handling of financial matters of importance or their fidelity to their duties. I can without difficulty recaîl manyv munici- palities which to-day have large amounts of sinking fund moneys in their local baniks drawing low rates of interest which could and should be invested in bonds of their own issues to much better advantage. Local brokers, friendly to politicians in office, are 'frequently know-r to have_ the \"cability\" to sell to their local sinking funds. bonds at rela- tively higher prices than reputable investment dealers are ,able to sell the samne securities. On the other hand, assuming the same issue of bonds to have been arraoged.to, mature 'in fifty an-nual instaîments, the results *qould be quite different. The annual amount apprépriated would have to.be i n the hands of the proper officials promptly to meet the maturing bonds each year when presented foi payment. By making the amount rnaturing each year increase Proportionately as the interest charge decreases, the burderi upon the taxpayer may bie so regulated that his tax to pay for each issue of bonds is unifoflfl throughout its life. There is no chance that moneYs wjll be improperly or unprofitably employed, as in effect eacb year 's payment is immediately invest.ed at the net rate that the issue bore when put out. Furthermore, the necessitY Of a careful audit of sinkingfund mo ntys at frequent intervals is done away with because the non-payment of any part Of the maturing interest or principal would immediately call forth inquiry which would correct any, irregularities before they could assume serîous proportions. Statutory Control of Municipal FInanolng. It îs not so many years ago that municipal financiflg was on such an unscientific basis that money borrowed by means of long-time bond issues was expended on short-lived improvements, or even given to railroads as \"bonuses\" to induce themn to build through certain areas, and no provision whatever. was made for the ultimate payment of the debt. With the increase i scope of municipal functions came mucb larger debts in proportion to the taxable values in many com- munities, and it became apparent that some businesslike scheme for paying such debts would have to bie adopteSl. Newly created States, profiting by the experiences of their older sîster States, made due provision in theîr constitu- tions and by legislative' acts to properly control the issuance of and arrange for the payment of the bonds issued bY the various Political sub-divisions. The New England States, with- ahl their reputed conservatism, have been very slow tO remedy some very glaring weaknesses in their fiýnancial structures. Massachusetts alone has any comprehiensive plan for the proper control of hier municipal financing, and that Starts present admirable laws were only adopted about twO years ago when it had become apparent that drastic reforms would have to be promptly made. Within the past year a Prominent banker in one of the larger cities in Connecticut told the writer that the officials of his city had refunded the entire amount of a maturing issue of bonds despite ýthe fact that the sinking fund accumulated to retire that particular issue amounted to a substantial portion of the whole. When 'asked for'an explanation the officiais naively stated that they expected to need that particular sinking fund money for an- other purpose and so had not applied it upo the paiment of the mnaturing debt. It is needless to say those officiais now know better how to conduct that city's financial affairs and the money is still in the sinking fund to, be used onlY ,for the payment of maturing indebtedness. No one will denY that sorne radical change in the laws of th at State is ad- visable to miake such Official laxity impossible. ReOgOnîz, Changing Conditions. New York, New jersey. and Pennsylvania were amfong the first of the older States to recognize changing conditions and to, provide conservatîv6 constitutional and 'legisîntive measures to require that each issue of bonds should be paid in full as it matured, and while.the sinking fund method of payment is permit.tedl for most of the political sub-divisions, there has been for Years a growing practice of voluntarilY using the serial payment plan. Tht Constitutional Con1vention, now in session in New York State, is onie of the most efficient bodies of mnen ever gathered together for sucha purpose, and the committees appoînted for the purpose of dealing with the financial Pro- visions of the constitution have gone about their work in a most gratifyîng manneF. The State debt has been created by long-time, straight maturity bonds, and that no lack Of Provision for the paymnent of the same has existed is attested by the fact that careful estimates place the excess sinking funds on hand at this time at $29,0o0,000. Mr. Henry L. Stimson as chairman of the committee on which he is serving has just: offered for adoption a plan to properly adjust the sinklng funds on the existing debt, to safeguard the invest- ment of the funds, and to require that any new bond issues shall mature serially and have a life not to exceed the use- fulness of the improvements to be installed with their pro- ceeds. This last provision is one which Massachusetts made in hier financial reform and is the '\"last word\" in public finance; its wisdom cannot be successfully challerged. The committee dealing with the constitutional changes affecting the financing of the subdivisions of the State bas also been giving careful thought to these pýroblems, and I believe itS finished mork will show equally satisfactory results.

REJECTING BIDS FOR BONDS The town of Petrolea, Ontario, has for sale $30,0oo 5 2 per cent. thirty-year bonds. Lt called for tenders and in response received a goodly number of bids. The town has notified the bidders of its decision not to accept any of the ofTers receîved, adding that the issue wvill be with- drawn for the present and that, by instruction of the city council, a lîst of the tenders would flot be published. The Monetairy Times believes that the rejection of alI the tenders was unwîse, especially in view of the conditions prevailing in the money markets. There is uneertainty as to what will have to be paid for tronley during the remainder of the year. The ten- dency is distinctly upwards. When the British war loan was floated in July On a 4'~ per cent. basis, a fresh standard of values7for ail stock exchange securities was set practically throughout the world. The most important borrower, namnely, the British governiment, acting under the most skilful and experienced advice, was obliged to pay 412 per cent. for money in July. Shortly afterwards, the Domninion governient, with excellent credit, had to pay 5 per cent. in the New York market. The money markets are in an unusually unsettled condition, owing to the rumors of a possible British loan in the United States, for a very large amnount. If ever there was a time when'Canadian municipalities should accept the best reasonable offer received for its securities, the time Îs now. One would have thought that even in the palmy days, the municipalities would have learned sufflciently expensive lessons from their unwise policy of \"waiting for better prices.?' As for the instructions of the counicil of the town of Petrolea, that the prices offered for their bonds should ntbe publîshed, it will interest the authorities to know that The Monetary Times has in its possession the exact figures of niany of the bids received by the town. Frorn the prices before us, it is obvious that among themn was at least one excellent offer and one which may not be received by the town again. The x aluation of securities held by insurance corn- panies doing business in Canada has always caused a difference of opinion. The question bas been raised again reccntly by an article in The Mlonetary Timnes regarding the differences between the public statein-ents of some insurance comipanies and those furnished to the insurance department at Ottawa. As to the proper basis to be adopted in connection with the valuation of securities, authorities differ on this side of the Atlantic. Many actuaries favor what is known as the amortization method, and much is to be said in favor of it, On the other side of the Atlantic, the majority of actuaries un- dotîbtedly favor the method of actual valuation as at the dat.e of the investigation. Neither system can be applied absolutely and without the exercise of judicial discrimination. Fýor example, under the system of actual values, it would be unwise and possibly dangerous in some instances for a company, during a period of inflation in the value of securities, to carry them into its statement at their present market value and take advantage of the apparent gain in connec- tion with the distribution of dividends to its members. On tHe other hand, it would be manifestly unfair to theý existing members so to value their securities during a period of depression in values resulting from a financial crisis or conditions such as existed last year upon the out- break of war. Such a êourse might mean in some in- stances an absorption of ahl surplus availabie for distribu- tien working an injustice to the existing policyholders, with a resultant undue advantage to thoseof later years. In evidence of this, the inequity which might result to policyholders by the striét application of the principle of market values was recognized by the Canadian in- surance department last year, when they decided to fix aIl values upon the somewhiat higher basis of a year ago. Similar departures have been made from this system of valuation in the United States. In fact, no measuring stick cari be rigidly employed without the exercise of some discretion and avoid working an injustice te the members or creatingy conditions which. may prove dangerous to their înterests. Colonel W. C. Macdonald, managing director and actuary Of the Confederation Life Association, discussing the matter with The Monetary Times, draws attention, however, to the fact that under the amortization method in which the security is carried on the books of the comn- pany at a value which will yield precisely the same rate of int-.rest return as that at which it was purchased, dis- regarding entirely present market values, the danger may be a tendency to, disregard or to consider whether the depreciated market value of the bond is due to existing financial conditions or to an actual depreciation in the inherent value of the security. This danger would naturally be greatest in companies which were not financially strong and which were desirous of making good showings in the form of dividend'returfis to their members.. ,Subject, however, to the exercise of proper judgment and discrimination, Colonel Macdonald inclines to the opinion that for a life insurance Company, the amortiza- tion system is the preferable and fairest to the poficy- holder, that is, in so far as it is applicable tq terminable securities such as bonds and debentures. In regard to ,stocks, their value must, lie thinks, without question be August 27, 1915.",
         "TRZ MONtETARY TI ME 8 Volume 55. determined on the basis of the. market quotations at the date of the investigation. As to the valuation of mortgages, theoretically the sane principle should be applicable to the valuation of a mortgage asto that of a bond. True, the fluctuation in the value of'the. mortgage is not only likely to be much less, but it is not so easily ascertainable, as mortgages are not a formn of security 'which are generally bought and sold on the open market. As this prominent actuary points out, during the past few years there has been a general trend upwards in the rate of interest obtainable upon mortgage investments, consequently all companies have*upon their books mortgages bearing a lower rate of. interest than the boan would be made at if entered upon at the present time. These securities are, therefore, carried on the company's books at a value somnewhat in excess of their actual, market worth. The application, however, of the principle of market values to mortgages is not so necessary, as the term for' which a mortgage usually runs is five years, and it is subject to adjustment at the end Qf that period, and under any circumstances. the difference between the book value and what might be regarded as the market value of the mortgage investmnents would not constitute a serious item in the accounts of any coxnpany. IZINC AND OTIIER BOUNTIES With a view to insuring at reasonable prices a Canadian supply of refined zinc, suitable for use in the production of brass for the manufacture of quick-firing cartridge cases for shelîs, the Dominion government has passed an order-in-council providing for bounties on re- fined zinc produced in Canada from Canadian ores. These bounties, however, are tentative, and will not go0 into effect unless the war is ended before July 3r, 1917. The reason for this is that the zinc'refiners are w 'illing to put in the necessary plant only on a guarantee that the orders fromn the Canadian shell committee will be. sufficient te defray the cost of installing the plants and give -a legiti- mate profit, or else that in the event of the war comning to a speedy close the bounty will be payable up to the end Of JulY, 1917. In anv case it is provided that the total amount of bounties to be paid shahl not exceed $400,o0o. As the successful prosecution of the war must be the first consideration, the arrangement which the government bas made is satisfactory. Bounties Iast year paid by the government amnounted to only $143,652, divided as folhows: Lead, $8,179; Manilla fibre used in the manufacture of binder twine and cordage, $,7,950; crude petroleum, $x 17,513. The varlous governmnent supervisors of bounty dlaims in re- spect to these three items, reported early this year that it did not appear that lead fromn the United States had up to that time invaded the English market, but it enters the Canadian and Oriental markets ia which our producers must seli, and hence regulates the price w}iich a Canadian shipper can get. Canadian manufacturers of binder twine operated theîr factories to, full capacity last year and for some time past have bee-n pushing a good fo!reign trade for twine as well as taking care of the home market. The oil market in Ontajrio, where most of the Canadian supply is found, did not show ituch activity last year. No new fields were opened and the whole trade 11,as very quiet. The bouinties on lead smelted in Canada are $15 per ton and these bountieS Will continue until June 30, 1918. On the production of crude petroleum, the bounty iS 1 I cents per gallon. The bounty on Manilla fibre is equal to 'the export duty on Manilla fibrein the Philippine islands or 75 cents perý hundred kilos (one kilo 2.,204 lbs. and* not to exceed 91 of i cent per pound). Bojinties were Previously paid on pig iron, puddled iron bars,' steel and manufactures of steel., These were discontinued at various times during the past three yearS. The total bounties paid by the Dominion government front June, 1896, to March, 1114 amounted to $21I,436,456- BANK MERGERS Usually the bank Jnerger cornes first and the stormn of protest later. In the case of the Royal Bank and the Bank of Hamilton the Storm came first and the amalga- mation may not corne at ahl, and not yet anyway, as the- finance minister has forbidden it. The'board of control of Hamilton city last week passed a resolution recording.- their opinion that the proposed amalgamnation would not be in the interests of the Dominion or of the ci tizens of Hamilton or of the city corporation. As such an amalga- mation, they said, would necessarily result in the removal of the head office of the Bank of Hamilton fromt Hamiltonl and would have the effect Of concentrating at Montreal the combined capital of the two bank s and of centralizing at Montreal the bank capital to the detriment of other portions of Canada, more. particularly Ontario province and especialy H-amlton city, they placed upon record their disapproval of the Proposed merger. There sems to be more sentiment than practical business in these objections. Would the city. of Hamil- ton, its institutions, its business men and its surrounding district have sufferedi from the viewpoint of bank credit as a resuit of the removal of the Bank of Hamilton? The Monetary Times thinks that they would not have done,50. The particular portion of the deposits, for exarnple,.ý coIlected in tht part of Ontario~ and placed, we will* say, on boan in New York, if transferred now to Montreal would probably continue tO go to New York or to London or to, the Canadian West, or wherever good business and' banking policy d ictates. One cannot earmark monley in the ay Wich s Oftel Suggested. There are no banks with headi office, West of Winnipeg. Yet enormous financing operations, eSpeciaîîy in regard to the crop movement are cae' on in Western Canada, but with deposits gathere\u003cj for the most part in Eastern Canada. The bank bcans in the West are very much in excess of",

In the hope that the zaaterial raay be of some interest they submitted a resumé of the results to the civic board of control. one period preceding the war and two succeeding the war were chosen, and the records of the registry office as pu'blished in the 'local press were followed. All sales for evidently nominal or fictitîous prices were rigidly ruled 'out,. Al others were included. The relations of assessment to sale price were finally tabulated for 229 improved properties \u003eand 97 unimproved. It was clearly recogniz-ed that several sources of error might enter here, such as the following- 1 * Houses might be erected or extensive improvements made followinig assessment. 2.- buses might be burned down 'after'assessment. 3. Sudden changes in values in restricted localities might occur through the making of public'impro'Vements. la Assesemont LaW Enforeod? Trheý resuit'S of these modifying circumstances,ý however, tend to neutralize one 'another so that,' on the whole, thq average percentage of assessed value on the-sale price as indicated by the study may not be far wrong. The bureau would respectfully suggest that in the proposed officiaI study, which will have ready access to ail records, an ex- tended analysis of assessments and sales of the last few years be made Aith the purpose of *throwing Iight on the following often-xaised questions: i. Is the present assessment law being carefully en- forced ? 2. Are assessmnent values being fairly well equalized? 3. Is unimproved property being 'given an advantageý over imiproved property or vice versa? 4.' Are small properties beîng tlaced at a disadvantage with large properties, Or vice versa? Average As'egomntt of i S Per Cent. The flrst group of 165 sales showed an average assess- ment of 6î ý5 per cent, on the sale price. The second group of 64 sales showed an average assessment of 57.7 per cent. In this group the asseSSMent of unimproved property aver- aged 39.2 per cent. of the sale Price and the assessment: of improved property averaged 67,.) per cent, on the sale price. The third group of ()S sales showed an average assessment of 6o.9 per cent. on the sale price. The percentages for un- îmaproved land was 51.8 per cent. and for improved land 63.29 per cent. In order to get resuits whÏich would not be vitiated to any extent by the inclusion of such errors as are enumerat-ed above a further analySis was made, excluding ail cases where the assessment fell beîow'40 per cent, or was above i20 per cent. of the sale price, notwithstanding the fact that somne of these sales mlight fairly have been included.

         "TUE ýýXONETARY .TIbIES Volume 55. BELGIUM'S BRAVE STORY Gilbert K. Chesterton, Famous Author, Tells It to The. Mortetary Times Readers The MWonetary Times bas received for publication the followîng striking letter fromn Gilbert K. Ch.esterton, the English man of.,letters: hopýe you will grant, me space to say a few words about.,the Beigians stili in Belgium. The admirable efforts of the National Committee for Relief in Beigium, are going a long way t9 avert famine, but if the miilion-and-a-half desiute,'Belgians are to be kept alive the National Com- mittee must have yet further support. The ornly conceivable cause of douýbt in the matter must lie ini a mere weariness in well-doing, produced flot by any intellectual difficulty, but by such xlholly uninteilectual things as time and fatigue. I think, therefore, the best way of preventing any possible neglect of sa great a matter is to repeat once more the great trutbs upon which rested the whole original 'claim,' flot so much on our sympathy as on our common honesty. The simplicity and enormity of the Belgian Story can best be set forth, perhaps, in four truisms, ail towerinkly self- evident., Badnoss of the StOrY. First.- 0f course, the mere badness of the story is almost too big ta be held in the mimd. There have been sturies, of -a woman, or a child actually robbed of reason for îf e by the mere ocular shock of some revolting cruelty done in their presepce. There was, really a danger of something of the kînd paralyzing our protest against the largest -and; by the help of God, the last of the crimes of the Prussian Kings. The onlookers might have been struck into a sort of gîb- bering imbecility, and even amiability, by the f ull and inde- tensible finality of the' foui stroko. We had no machines that could measure the stunning directness of the blow- from bell. We could hardiy realize an enormous public act which the actor did flot wish to excuse, but only to execute. Yet such an act was the occupation of Beigium; almost the only act in bistory for which there was quite simply and literally nothing to be said. Bad bistory is the whoie basis of Prussia: but' even in bad history the Prussians couid find no precedent 'and no -palliation; and the more intelligent Prussians did not try. A few were so feeble-minded as to.say tbey had found dangerôus documents in Brusseis, as if what they had done could possibly be excused by things they did not know when they, did it. This almost piteous lapse in argument was, however, covered up by the cleverer Prussians as quickly as migbt be. They preferred ta stand witbout a rag of rea son on them than wîtb such a rag as that. Before we corne ta the monstrous material suffering, there is in the existing situation an abstract finreason, nay, an abstract însanity, wbich the brain of man must not bear. A nigbt- mare must not abide ta the end. The tiniest trace ofPrus- sian victory that remains will make us tbink of something whicb is not ta bc thought of:- of something like the victary of the beasts over mankind. ProhIstoro Cruslty. Second. It must be remembered that this' murder bas been dbne ÙùpOn a people of such proximity and'familiarity that there cannot be any mîstake about the matter. There îs some shadowy justification for the comparative indiffer- ence ta the wrongs of very. remote peoples: for it is not easy for us ta guess how mucb« siavery sbocks a negro or cani- baliîsf a cannibal. But the innkeepers and shoPkeepers of Ostend feit exactly as the innkeepers and shopkeepers of Dover wouid feel. We have ta imagine a pre-historjc cruelty coming suddenlY upon a scene wbi.cb was civilized and aimost commonpiace. Imagine tigers breaking out of the Zoological Gardens and eating all the People in Albany Street; imagine Red Indians exhibited at Olympia literally scalpîng every passer-by -from that place to'Uammersmith Broadway; imagine Jack the Ripper crowned king of Wbite- chapel and conducting bis executions in broad dayhight out- side the Tube station at Aldgate; imagine as mucb as you can of what is Violent and contradi'ctory in an aver-turni of ail modern life bY troglodytes; and you are stili falling short of this fearful Belgian scene in that f amiliar Belgian scenery.. It. is idie ta taik of exaggerations or misrepre- sentatiOfis about a caýse sa close to us. Chinese tortures may flot be c1uite so fanitastic as travellers -tell us; Siberia may not be su desolate as its fugitives say it is; but we cOUldý no more invent sucb a massacre in Belgium than v.e could a massacre in Balham. The things of shameless shame that have been done are something worse than prodigies, WOrse than' nigbtmares, worse than devilries; tbev arefacts. 13olglum Stands Alono. Third. This people we have hbeard of daily have endured this unheard of tbing; and endured it for us. There are countless cases for compassion among the bewilderiflg and heartrending by-products of this war; but this is not a case for compassion. This îs a case for that mere working mnini- mumi of a sense of honour that makes us repay a pour man wbo bas advanced bis last penny ta post a letter we have forgotten ta stamp. In this respect Belgium' stands alOne; and the dlaims even of other Allies may well stand aside till she is paid ta the uttermost farthing. Tbere bas' beeni self-sacrifice everywbere else; but it was self-sacrifice of indî- viduals, each for bis own country; the Serbian dying for Serbia, or the Italian for Italy. But the Belgian did flot merely die for Belgium. Beigium. died for Europe. Not oniy wa s the soldier sacrificed for the nation ; the nation was sacrificed for mankind. It-is a sacrifice whicb is, I think, quite unique even amang Christians; and quite indOndeiv- able amna'ng pagans. If we even privatelyý utter a murmur, or even- privaiely grudge a' penny for bindîng the wvounds Of sa solitary and exceptional 'a martyr, we ourselves shaîl be soinething aimost as solitary and exceptional. We shall, Perbaps, -be nearest ta the state of tbat unspeaka-bie socialo\" gist wbo persuaded bis wife ta partake of a simultaneous suicide; and then bimseif cheerfully lived on. ButoherS of the Nation. Faurtb. If there be anyane on this eartb wbo does Dot find the final success of sucb crime more than- the mînd can bear; if there be anyone wbo does not feel it' as the more graphic,' since it w-alks amonýg the tramway lines and lamp-posts of a life like aur owfl; if there be anyone W110 doe flot f eel that ta be caught napping about Belgium '5 like beingý caught robbing one's miother on- ber death-bed; there stil remnains a sort of brutal »comnpassion for badilY pain, whbich bas been half-admitted here n hr e l the oppressors themiseîves.I ed not do a greac da more even than we bave already done, it may yet be said Of us that w-e left it ta the very butcbers of this nation ta see that it did flot bieed ta death. 1, therefore, plead for further help for the members of the National Coinmittee wbo have taken this duty upOn themselves.

         "20 THE MONE WAR ORDERS IN CANADA Officiai List of British Government's Purchases Here Total $230,OOO,OOO Last month The Monotary Times published a carefully compiled estimate of the orders placed in Canada for~ ammuni- tion and general war supplies, by the British, French and Russian governments and by the Dominion 'government for the equipment of its expeditionary forces. The total value of these orders was placed at $394,ooo,ooo. A week later in an address at Toronto, Sir George Foster, mînister of trade and commerce, practically confirmed this figure, stating that the value of the orders was \"approlcimately $400,ooo,ooo.\"l Further information regarding the value of war orders has now corne ta The Monetary Times from the department of'trade and commerce, Ottawa. General interest is being taken by pro. ducers and manufacturers as to war supplies provided by Canada, mainly as regards the British government and, in a lesser degree, as regards, the governments of the Allies. The question as to whether as much is being supplied from Can- ada as can reasonably be provided is being thoroughly dis- cussed, and assertions vary according to the sources of the in- formation or the ýstrength of the imagination of the Parties thereto. It is comparatively easy to make a statement of what has been supplied by Canada in respect ta purchases made by the allied governments through direct agency of the government of Canada. Rieliable statistics are available and the informa-, tion can be f airly accurately given. For the large quantity of materials, directly or indirectly meant for war purposes, which are purchased in Canada outside of direct government contract, greater dilficulty is experienced in coming even at approximate values. The department of trade is taking steps ta get information in regard to this branch of supply, but lack of knowledge of the private parties and corporations that are interested renders the task somewhat difficuit. As to what is being contracted for by the governments concerned with companies or private dealers, accurate in- -formation is possessed by the purchasing authorities of each govern -me nt, but it is difficuit for the Canadian government to possess itself of these from the governments ooncerned. As to indirect- suppli 'es, there is a large margin with reference to which it seems impossible to getany information. Here is an official statement of contracts and purchases made in Canada by the British government to date. A great deal of what is shown in the table has already been despatched and paid for. A larger part probably is still under contract for delivery accordizig to the conditions of the contract. It 'will 4,e seen that the detailed value of orders executed or under execution for the British government in reference to war supplies amounts to about £46,oooOoo ($230,ooo,ooo), distributed over a considerable, area.

CA.NADIAN TRADE IMPROVES The total Canadian trade for july reached $ 100,000,o00, according to a statement issued by J. D. Reid, Minister of Customs. For the corresponding month of 1914 the total trade axnointed to $93,ooo,ooo. The feature of the statement îs the large increase in the domestic and foreign exports. During the month, domestic exports reached $45.600.000, and foreign goods exported froin Canada totalled $1 6,oooooo, compared with $4î,000,OOo doxnestic and $8,ooo,ooo foreign for the corresponding -month of 1914. About $ i 1,000,000 worth of animaIs was exported during July, being a sub- stanitial increase over the saine month last year.

         "THE )IONETARY TIXES VIEWS 0F BANK MERGEe QUÂSIIING Bank Shareholders and Bank Business-Fear of a Mouey Trust The daily press of Canada have printed interesting comments rçgarding the proposed bank merger which the finance rninister will flot 'sanction. The Toronto World, whîch first pri'nted a story, in breezy language, as to the Suggested amalgamation, says«. \"The minister of finance does flot have ta consuit his colleagues in the cabinet in regard to these mergers; the dut\u003e' il placed on him b\u003e' act of parliament of approving or disapproving of these mergers, and the whole responsibilit\u003e' is, therefore, on hum; and he is clothed with full power to demand that ail the facts be submitted to him. The intention of the law furthermore was that before any step be taken in the direction of a mnerger those suggesting it should first consuit the minister. not after they had secret\u003e' laid their plans. The minister has a right to demand ail the facts, also the names of. those who are to' benefit personally by reason of the merger, and who,' under the guise of advancing the interests of the shareholders, are seeking ta make money for themnseives out of the' deal.\" Businée wlth Publi.0 Fundo. That the depositors' side of the case should be heard is the contention of the Toronto Mail, which says: cChartrd banks of Canada are not private institutions with responsibilities oni\u003e' to their shareholders. They, are Public institutions b\u003e' virtue' of the fact that the great bulk of the funds 'wherewith they do business' are public funds, and the\u003e' must, therefore, be amenable ta the public interest as weli as to the shareholders' The time il gone when it can be contended that bank shareholders have a right ta do with the bank business as they please because it is theirs.yy Fm\"r of a Money Trust. 'What the minister has do\u0026ne il to serve notice that ihe Canadian people wili not tolerate the creation of a mone\u003e' trust in the Dominion,\" says the Toronto Globe, which adds : \"Already the smalî graup of men who control the vast assets of the Bank of.Montreai, the Bank of Commerce, and the Royal Bank exercise tremendous power over the fortunes of hundreds of tbousands of business men. Were these great and pawerfui institutions ta continue to gather together the assets af the smaller banks the time might speedil\u003e' corne when a cou~ple of dozen gentlemen sitting around the direc- tors' tables in two or three bank board rooms in Montreai and Toronto would be in a position to control a billion dollars or more of deposits entrusted ta them by the people of Canada. The Globe believes that power so great should not be concentrated. ini the hands of a few men, fia matter how able or disinterested they may be. Mr. White, who has had the advantage of observing \"ýhigh finance\" from the inside, bas evidently came to the saine conclu sion. He has done weil in forbiddiig- the banns. There is -need for campetition in banking as in al other business enterprises\"- \"Disaster would not be the immediate consequence of further officiai surrenders t o t he craze for amalgamating banks,\" sa\u003e's the editor of the Toronito~ Evenimg Telegrain. c'The minister of finance bas saved this c0unmtry's bariking systeni froin the operation of tendenies more dangerous than the attacks aimed at the systemn b\u003e' a few Parliamenary\u003e and press assailants. These tendencies'have only ta triumph in the unrestraîned, unregulated, uncîmecked manipulation of Canada's bankirng organization ýand diase may be post- poned, but cannot be prevented.\" Some VI.ws in Faveur. A different view is taken b\u003e' the Montreal Gazette (Con- servative\u003e. As ta the objection taken to the absorption of Ontario capital by institutions from aother province, it says: ccIt can be~ believed this latter view had fia influence in the shaping of the decision reached by the finance min- ister, because it represents a geographical prejudice and flot a principle. It crops up or draps down according to cirpcumStanceS of no broad meaning.\" it continues.:\"h fact is a bank's transactions are not confined ta the cit\u003e or tow ii whcbit s lcatd.Bankcs which do a large busi- ness with grain and produce dealers must almost Of Dec'es- sity have an agency or an agent in Montreal; and what il' the case in this mnatter is the case in some way or' other alsa in regard to ail other branches of trade.' When a transaction begun« sav in Brantford,, is concluded ini Mont- reai, time and trouble, and even expense, may be saved if in both chties an ageOcy of the lame bank is conicerne\" There are other economical considerations alsa which ap- pear to, make, the large bank with branches spread tirough- out sections of the country the fittest; and in. banks fitness means abilit\u003e' ta meet the demands of the business coIfl mnunmtY. In the case immediatel\u003e' in question the share- hoiders of the two institutions concerned are those PrimarliY and chiefi\u003e' interested, and their views should not be disre garded except for reasonable public considerations.\" COBALT ORE 81IIPMENTS The foliowiîng are the shipments of are, in pounds, froln Cobalt Station for the week ended August 2oth, 1915*- Peterson Lake Silver Mine, Seneca Superiar Ore, 64, 475; McKinleyDarrangh-Savage MnS86*NPsig Minig Copany' 129,453; Dominion Reduction Company' 176,000; Mining' Corporation of, Canada, Townsite City' Mines, 62,445-, Mining Corporation of Canada, Cobalt Lake Mine, 86,355.

         "TRE XONETARY TIXlES GIOVERNMENT OBJECTS TO BANK MERGER Amalgamation Would Net be in the Public Interest, Says Finance Minister White With regard to the tentative proposals for the amalga- mation of the Royal Bank of Canada and the Bank of Hamiltoni, which have been placed before bim, the minister ,of,.financ.e\u003e Hon.__W1. T. Whitç. -ba\u0026'=ttdthat after giving the matter very careu 1-consideration he has reached the con- clusion that as both the banks in question are strong, favor- ably known and well-established institutions, and are actiial and potential competitive factors in the Canadian banking field, it would not be in the public interest that lie should give the consent required from him under the terms of the bank act, and the interested parties have lbeen notified accordingly. Objections at Hamilton. SThe board of control of Hamilton city last week passed the following resolution: \"Whereas it is uÈderstood that representatives of the Royal Bank, of Montreal, and the Bank of Hamilton have discussed with the minister of finance tentative proposais which have been made for the amalgamation of the 'cwo banks; «'And whereas the board of control of the council of the corporation of the city of Hamilton is of the opinion that such amalgamation would not be in the interests of the Dominion or of the citizens of Hamilton and the city cor- poration, as such amalgamation would necessarily resuit ini the removal of the head office of the Bank of Hamilton from this city, and would have the effect of con'entrating at Montreal the combined capital of the two banks and of cen- tralizing at Montreal the bank capital to the detriment of other portions of Canada, more particularly the province of Ontaria, and especially the city of Hamilton; \"Be it, therefore. resolved that this board place upon record ïts disapproval of sucli amalgamation, and that the secretarv endeavor to arrange a joint meeting of represen- tatives of the board of trade and the manufacturers' asso- ciation, city members of parliament and of the legislature, and this board to discuss the pproptosedtamalgamation and the advisability of rnaking apitonoth minister of finance to refuse giving consent to such amalgamation\"~ Opinions Wero DIvIdd. There was a special meeting in the mayor's office at Hamilton on Friday, last week, to discuss the proOO5d merger of the Bank of Hamilton with the Royal Bank Of Canada. There were representatîves from the city coun cil, the board of trade, the manufacturers' association and Alla\"i Studholme, M.P.P., and John Allan, M.p.P., and T. J- Stewart, M.P The meeting seemed to be about equallY divided. Three city representatives were much opposed to the mnerger, and were backed up by Controller Cooper. Messrs* Arthur Hatch, S. F. Washington and others, were firm in insisting that the merger was none of the city's business, and that it was impudent for the city to interfere. No con- clusion was arrived at beytond a recommendation to îeave the 'natter to the city coundil. After the meeting adjourned a telegram. was forwarded to the minister of finance asking that the amalgamatiun be held up until the city wa heard from. Last Yearls Morgor. The latest bank amalgamation was in July, îgi4, when the Bank of Nova Scotia absorbed the Metropolitan Bank* Th ems under which the Metropolitan 'became a part of the Nova ýScotia were $20o in cash and one share of the BankC of Nova Scotia stock for each two shares of the MetroPolitan Bank. As an institution, the Metropolitan Bank received $1,000,00Oo in cash and 50 shares of the Bank Of Nova Scotîa stock. The market price of shares cf the Bank of Nova Scotia was then around,$264. and Metropolitan stock stood at $205 bîd. Under the terms of the agreement, the stock figured at $232 per share.

The Dominion Canners Company then contnolled the situation, and various opinions were expressed as to the prices charged for their products,- but the nesults were soon observable. Between thirty and forty independent factories started manufacturing and marketing their products, and as the Dominion can absonb onîy about 5o per cent. of the Output of the existing factories, a pnice-cutting campaign comn- menced. The results were soon evident. Senator Smith 're- cently told The Moneftary Times the conditions prevailîng in the industry \"would pnactically drive those who have not already gone into bankruptcy;, into it, fon the losses have been enormous.\"1 ObJeot. of Organization, The main objects of the company, in the words of those pn.imarily interested, are: (i\u003e To secure markets for the lange surplus outputs of the various coxnpanies. (2) To obtain a reasonable profit on manufacturing operations asid eliininate price-cutting. On a question by TAc 'MOnetarY Times as to possible higli prices in the future, -this was the answer: \"The results fromn the follv of thé higli prices in oii and 1912 Will flot soon be forgotten, and this expérience alone -wlll prevent a repetition.\" ITALIAN8 HERE CAN SUBSCRIBE FOR LOAN The Canadian B3ank of Conmmerce, as correspondent of the Banco di Napoli, is authorizedi by the Royal Government of Italy to receive subscriptions from Italians résident in Canada, to the national loan issued by th, Italian Government on June, i5th.

A. Downie of Messrs. D. A. Downie and Company, farm land expert, spoke to The Monetary Times in an interview this week. \"Two weeks from.now,\" hie con- tinued, '\u003cevery line of railway and every branch, north, south and west will be pouring into Winnipeg and On to the lakes, its long, slow, but surely moving quota of heavily laden cars. \"~This year flot only means money'and new business ta Manito'ba, but practically an aid to 11f e itself for the Empire. It has always been a very 'sure province, but one is almost forced to believe that the soil itself and nature had heard the appeal for 'More production' and that, silently, without visible motion, but yet surely, slowly, but with great effedt withal, the -appeal has been answered, and to-day, from the inter- niational boundary. to the northernmost limits, -the briglit harvest sun looks down on mile after mile of 'wheat, some stiil standing, some in stook, but everywvhere the binder and the workman and the thresher getting into safety ane of the finest if nat the finest crop Manitoba has ever produced.\"\u003e Summer FaIIow for Noxt Year. Mr. Downie is a well informed man on farming condi- tions, and last week in a motor trip in northern Manitoba, hie said:- \"Motoring from Neepawa, north, mile after mile, through McCreary, Ste. Rose, Ochre River to Dauphin, to the east, it is simply mile after mile of wheat, oats, and barley, thick and heavy, with occasional fields of summer fallow ready for for next yearls crop. On the west, for the whole distance of over one hundred miles, sometimes only two or tliree miles distant, again ten or fifteen miles away, the Riding Mountains rîse sharply and abruptly to a height of almost twelve hundred feet above the level of the general country. Then, by the Canadian Northern Railway, one hundred miles ta Swan River town and a motor run next day of one hundred and, twenty miles through rich valley lands, wheat waving in the wind, not quite as far advanced as farther south, but thirty to fifty bushels to the acre, and all practically secure. \"For the past year, business conditions in Neepawa, Dauphin and Swan River,\" said Mr. Downie, \"the judicîi and real business centres of northern Manitoba, have been very quiet. There was a good crop last year over most of this belt, especially Dauphin and Swan River, but with the curtailing of credits all round, the farmers were Torced ta realize that they had ta meet their obligations with cash a nd get on a more secure credit foundation. A large amount of debt was cleaned up but business was very slow all duringý the winter and spring of 1915. The merchant could flot give the usual credit and thie fariner did not want it pravided lie could get along witliout it. The result is that the local mer- chants and the machine men are complaining that the farmer has learned lis lesson just a little too well, that he is econo- mizing more than the lesson was meant to teacb. The loan companies' agents are complaining that this faîl, the farmer is going ta pay up instead of renewing or placing a new loan. J{owever, it is a good place to be. It means that, locally any- 'way, there will be an abundanch of funds. It means that the farmers' sons are going to stay at homne or purchase that nearby quarter of wild land. Tt rneans that the inerchants will get cash for their goods and the whalesaler his, on ,NMepa lB Prosperous. gNeepawa has always been ane of the most prosperous towns in northern Manitoba. Good banking facilities and everything ta provide for the ricli, well settled community they have had there for years. Eighteen years ago there was a long string of freighters pulling out ai day and long into the nîghts fo r the new Dauphin couritry. Along the foot of th, hiils and on ail the streains, nightf ail found thein camped every place. Then, the advent of the Canadian Northern Railway and the Dauphin country opened up. Then, a' few years later, the Swan River country.

W. Butler, vice- president of the Canadian Car and Foundry Companîy, states that au order for toc, box cars, valued at $îoooao, had been' received from the Alberta and Great Waterways RaÎlWay Company, and the Edmonton, Dunvegaun and British Col- umbia Railway. The company also secured an order frorli the samne source for '$ raooo worth of switch and frog material, which 'will beý manufactured by their subsidiarY, the Canadian Steel Fouindries. It is understood also that the'National Steel Car Coin- Palny, of Hamilton received an order from the EdMOênton, Dunvegan and Brîisýh Columbia Railway for ten Stock cars' The value of the consignineat was placed at $125,000. MANITOBA COVERNMENT TrELEpIIONES Mr. -A. W. Smith, secretary of -the public utiities comn- mission of Manitoba, writes The Monetary Times regarding figures published in these columns recently as to the finalIcial Position of the Manitoba Government telephones as at November 3oth, 1914. 'He says: \"The figures gîvefl are correct, but I desire ta point out that included un the $1' 346,365 as Operating eicpenses is the sum of $409,536-re- placement reserve. cIi utiglt mention that the policy of providing for re- placement reserve was inaugurated by this Commission in 1913, fixed sums being annuaîîy arrived at. T -he balance as at Novemnber 3oth, 1914, amounted ta $753,046, and the sun Of $422,163 has been fixed for îgî5.\"1 DOMINION TRUST AND CUARANTEE BOND r. ,j.Baird, barrister, of Vancouver, has been i 1I structed by the British Calumbia Governuient to issue a writ against the Railway Passengers Association Company for the sum of $200,o, the amount of the bond issued by the company on behaîf of the Dom~inion Trust Company. The suit 'S ta be entered in the namne of the Hon. W. J. Bawser, as provincial minister. Explaining this action, Mr. Bawser stated, according tO the Vancouver Press, that at the last session of the legisiature, ithe effort to relieve the plight of those wlio had suffered by the collapse of the Domainion Trust Company, a vote af $200,000, the amnount of the bond, was included in the esti- mates, ta be paid out as soon as the liquidatar should be able ta state who aught ta be the recipients. A speedy settleneflt was precluded owing ta the fact that certain depositors taOlk the position that they were creditors. Mr. E. P. Davis, K'C, was retained by the governmnent ta represent these depositars- The liquidatar naw states that lie is in a position ta prove that default lias been made by the Dominion Trust Comnpanly in the repayment of trust maneys under the Trust Companies' Act, which are cavered by d'e bond. This makes it necessary it is contended for the inurance coxnpany ta repay the $200,' 000 which is to be distributed, but the campany has refused paynient. Thte Monetary Times understands 'that $80ooo of the $2o0,ooo bond îssued by the Rallway Passengers Assurance Company, was reinsured by ather companies.",
