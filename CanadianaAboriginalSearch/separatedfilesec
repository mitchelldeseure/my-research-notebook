         "£ / ' A SOCIAL DEPARTURE suggest ^ es RTHODOCIA, as her name implies, is an English girl. No fond Transatlantic parent ever thougljt of calling any of us Orthodocia. It would be impossible to find a godmother to take the' responsibility. She would hâve to be an English godmother, caught touring, and an English godmother would know better. She would focus hereye glass wi^th a littje shudder uponthe small pink bundle of undeveloped un- conventionalities presented to her, and sweetly __ Hetrodocia instead— and another sponsor. Moreover I couldn't possibly iutroduce an American Orthodocia to the Brit'ish public, up in its Henry James, and understanding the nature^of a Paradox. Nobody would look at her. I met Orthodocia originally on a sandy point of the peninsula of Yucatan. She looked very pretty, I remember,\" picking upmuddy conch shells ail shiny and pink inside, and running to her auntlv chaperon with them for admiration. I remember, too, that she did not get the admiration, b«t a scolding. ' Look,' said the chaperon look at your front brea^th ! ' Orthodocia was eighteen then, but she looked at her front breadth, and went away very low in her mi^^wid sat down remotel^ on th^Peiùosula of ¥ucatan and ^ made a dreadful mess of her back one. It was this little incident, 1 thmk, that drew me to Orthodocia.",
         "\\-l \u003c\\ I ¥.i 2 A SQCIAL DEPARTURE It does not in the least inatter what had happened in the four years between Yucatan and the port of Montréal last September, where I met Orthodocia again. You will believe that a good deal had liappened when you understand that she was quite by herself, and prepared for a trip round tlie world with a person^her relatives had been in the habit of mentioning as ' that American young lady,' which was mo. Naturally you will think of matrimony first, which casualty would hâve enabled Oï-thodocia to go to tlie planet Mars alone, I believe, with the f ull approval of ail lier friends and acquaintances. But matrimony . i; \\- ~K^».- ^-: had not be- ^„-- ^=x-r' \" fallen-her : she*^' was stiîl Ortho-docia May Ruth Isa- bel Love, of Love Lodge, near^ St. Eve's-iii- the-G^r- den, Wig- ginton, Devon. Neither had she become an heiress, with nobody to thwart her vagrant fancies. Neither had the chaperon of Yuca^àn been gathered to her foremothers, leaving sad associations of grey curls and pince-nez cmstering about a place which none coilld fill. Orthodocia had ^tmply prevailed ; but as she told me in confidence there on the Montréal wharf just how difficult she found it, and what an extràordinary amount of trouble she had with the second wife of a cousin by marriage about it, I hâve no intention of letting you know how she did it. I feel that a certain amount of^retieenc on this subject is due to Mr. and Mrs. Love. Orthodocia was surrounded by the captain iiùd three quarter- , SAT DOWN BE- MOTELY ON THE PENINSULA OF",

Tliey had ail received tlieir instructions on the other side of the Atlantic, and were deter- mined that she should not escape to the formless dangers of Mr. and Mrs. Love's imagination, unless under circurastapces that would acquit them. The situation would hâve worried me. I should hâve taken a few of the quartermasters and stewardesses apart, and with silvery palms and accents ent^ated them to leave me: But Oi-tho- docia stood in their midst placid and comfortable. She was evidently accustomed to it. I hâve said that Orthodocia arrived in Montréal prepared for a trip round the world. This, considering her baggage, is an inadé-quate statement. It would hâve taken her comfortably through the universe with much apparel to spare, I should say, in a rough esti- mate. Ail the quartermasters who were not watching over her person were engaged in superintending the removal of her effects, relievçd at intervais by the ship's officers. There were two long attenuated boxes, and two short apoplectic ones. There was a small brown hair trunk, and a large black tin case. There was a collection of portmanteaux, and a thing she called a despatch-box, that properly belonged to her papa. There were two tin cylinders containing millinery, I believe. And there was a sitz bath tub— a beautiful round, shining, symmetrical sitz bath tub. I cannot cotascientiously say tliat Orthodocia's fuU name was painted on, that object. In the brief instant I gave to its contemplation, I certàinly saw a legend of some sort in white levers, butit may hâve been only the Devon. si ire address from which it had innocently wandered, in which case it may hâve been restored by this timo to its native WiggiAton. For there is no use in concealing the fact that in the course of Wy long, serions, private conversation with the drayman ^offering the lowest contract for removing Orthodocia's luggage, I eiijoined hh carefully to lose that sitz bath, and he did. When I came back to Orthodocia, af ter instructing the drayman\\ I found'her kneeling in a secluded corner before her open boxes^A surrounded by a sea of fine linen, and wearingii sîriâirfnûïïîphant^ expression about the corners of lier mouth. A man i» brass buttons hovered as near as he daretk lookiug troubled and unhappy. 'I",

He said a few minute!» ago that I might \"leave it to him ! '* ftnd I told him that I would do nothing of the kind. As . if one would let a man go through ail this ! ' And Orthodocia waved , her arm to include a quan^ty of the nearest embroid- eries. At the same moment she shook oiit a flannel petti- coat at the man in buttons, austerely remarking, ' \"^ou see there's nothin\u003cr dutiable in that !

' Really,' said Ortho: docia, sweetly ; «how nice ! ' Then she-held out her hand to the superior officer, who took it, regarded it attentive^ for a minute, turned a deep terra-cotta colour, and dropped St very hastily' ,'Thank you so^ïei^rauqh ! ' he said, lifting his cap to her, and bowing in an angle of forty-five degrees, with his feet very close togé^her, like an A.D.O. He was a young Customs officer and equal to the occasion. Moreover, as his salary did not, in ail pro- ' babihty, exceed tifteen hundred dollars a year, he may hav« been \\ glad of the shilling Orthodocia bestowed upon bim. At ail evenis when he was introduced to hér at Lady C. P. R. Magnifm'sdançè an evenmg or two later, and begged the pleasure of the fifth waltz It hung r^und and resplendent from the guarA that crossed his waistcoat.

This was surprising, because I ^ hadalways been toi d that English girls travelled in an assortment of old Glothes, a blue veil, and a pair of copper-toed leather boots with- ou- heels, and didn't care ; while American ones followed the exarpple of their illustrious predecessor, the Queen of Sheba, and ' cared a great deal.

Then we discovered, by telegraphing, that the Rev. Thring had raigrated, some ten years before, to the State of lUincùs, which did not lie in our way either.

Instead of which, as you know, she was only twenty two, with a pinkness and healthi- • ness which subtracted a year or two from that ; she hadri't a theory about her except that one shquld say one's prayers and look as well as possible under ail circumstances, and her inexpérience in the practical concerns of life seemed appalling. True, she could walk ten miles in her broad-toed boots, and slay any member of the family with a tennis-bail at a hundred yards, but thèse qualifications, original and valuable as tljey seemed, hârdly gave my friends the sensé çtf^ecurity they expected to dérivé from Ortho\u003ciocia's c^^uper- onage.

Who would look af ter our luggage î We suggested, with the gently disciplinary air of two who hâve their quarrel just, that there was ouly one changd of cars, so to speak, between Montréal and Yoko-hama, and that the C.P.R. porters were reliable. It was unheard of that two young women tehould go wandenng aimlessly oflF to the other side of the globe ! Whereupon the intention of thèse présent articles was disclosed with dignity, and the momentous mission in- volved in enlightening the home public as to the amount of truth in Gilbert and SuUivan's assertion that flirting is prohibited by-tl^e Mikado. If we penetrated into the interior we would be ch(^Plci up to give a secular âavour to missionary croquettes ; if w^v^tur^d to stay in the capital it was quite likely that some fat Mandarin would take the advantage of a wife, or wives, conversant with European cookery, and entice us into his seraglio — those Japanese were known to be adopting foreign ways. People who are not going to Japan, and are unfamiliar with the encyclopsedia, can't be ex- pected to know that Mandarins grow in China and seraglios in Turkey, so we forgave this, and many other things which the Britannica would hâve enabled us to set at naugjit. We exercised forbearance, valour, and magniticent persévérance, and we prevailed. ' What,' said Orthodocia, in the days of discussion that followed, • is the \" Seepiar \"V ' The C.P.R.,' I answered her, ' is the most masterly stroke of internai economy a Government ever had the courage to carry out, and the most lunatic enterprise a Government was ever foolhardy enough to hazard?

Then the gentleman came in from the smoking car, and turned eut to be a perfectly inotfensive little English curate, as new to the customs of the aborigines as Orthodocia, and quite as deeply distressed. ' Per- haps— perhaps you would prefer my sitting up ? ' he said unhappily. * Oh no,' said Orthodocia, ' VU sit up.' ' But really '- protested the curate.

I suppose, if I had not been wiUing, after performing my own toilet, to hold the top curtains together while Orthodocia made her exit, both she and the cûrate might hâve been there still. We entered after that, the little curâte and Orthodocia and î, into the most araicable relations, for it took us two days to get tô Winnipeg, which was our first stopping-place, and nobody can sit within three feet of a small thin pale Ritualist,,an alieninthe Cana- dian North-West, for two days, without feeKng sorry for him and wishing to mitigate his lot in every possible way. So we fed liim with chicken sandwiches from our hamper and made him cups of tea with our spirit lamp, and he in return gave us each three throat lozenges and some ^cellenl^ spiritual nourishment in the form of tracts. He was going, he said, to labour in Assiniboia among the Indiâus, and hoped it would not be long before he could expostulate with thera in their own tongue. In fact, he had quite expected to hâve picked up something of the language by this time. Possibïy I could speak»a little Crée ? He- was disappointed, I thiuk, to fiud tliat the aboriginal dialects did not sui-vive more widely. The country for the first day was very grim and barren and dreary. We rushed along through a wildeniess of rocks and stmited shrubs, Juniper chiefly. The great boulders thrust themselves through the scanty grasses like gaunt shoulders through a ragged gown. Now and then a spray of yellowing maple or of reddening oak broke the grey raouotony, or the rocl^s blossomed into lichens, . but this only gave an accent to the gênerai désolation. And steadily travelhng with us ail along the sky-line went a fringe ofHackened fars, martyred memorials of forest fires. That alliterative expression belongs properly to the curate, whose dépression was f rightful about this time, and whom I saw write it dowh in his notebook.

I think when the ^qrld grew orthqdox, they exiled Pan to the north shore of Lake Superior, its beauty is so conscious, so strong, so eternal. On the morning bf the third day we began to see fences and an occa^ional cow, and then we rëjoiced, for we knew we were nearing Winnipeg and t^ Manitoban approach to civilisation. At about ten o'clock we aririvcd. I don't think the émigration agents hâve left much to say séripùsly about Winnipeg, which they probably call the ' Prairie City,' and chromo-lithograph in other ways with their usual-skill, so I will treat it from Orthodocia's point of view, which cannot* be called serions. Her first surprise was, a cab — a four- wheeler, with two horses. Her next was the popular style of archîtectm^ ' Queen Anne ! ' wie said under her breath. ' I dis- tincjjy-'^derstood that the settlers lived in log-hutfi ! ' She asked to be driven at once to the Hvdson Bay trading post, to see the Indians bringing in their peltries and exchanging them for guns and knives — a scène which she said she had always imagined with plea- sure. I took her to the Hudson Bày trading post because I wanted to gratify her and to buy a pair of six-button Jouvin's at the same tinie ; and, of course, there wasn't an Indian anywhere in the vicinity of that extremely fashionable establi^ment, or a peltry either. Our Winnipeg hostess lived in one of the Qtieen Anne houses, and I could perceive Orthodocia's astoïiishment rîising within her as she obs^-ved the ordinal y interior gamishings of Tyrkish rugs and Japanese vases and Spq^e teacups, * I rather expected,' she said to me privately, * deers' horns and things.' And when I ■arcastically suggested wampura and war hatchets, she answered with humble sincerity, ' Yes.'

I was ràther glad Orthodocia didn't find any Tndian chiefs there, as she expQcted, though perhaps she would hâve preferred that sensation ; and I was distinctly gratified when I passed her in conversation witlj^a younger son in corduroys at the réception,, looking glum, who fiad just come out to waste his sub-stance în ; Manitoba, and heard hira inform her that ' WeaÙy, you !\u0026now, for natives — it's weally wathah wum.'

         "ri i6 A SOCIAL DEPARTURE :. i lU OuK next, travelling acquaintance was a lady. We were sp^eding out from Winnipeg — out and away into the prairie world— aiid we stood on the rear platform of the car, watching the city sink like a fleet of many-masted ships on the'rim o£ the horizon. Sbe stood with us looking back too ; holding up a thin, ]t)ony, much-Veîned hand to keep the sun out of her eyes. She did not try to keep the regret out of them, not thinking, perhaps, that anybody noticed her. We didn't notice her much either, the prairie world was so new to us. It was a wide wide world of heaving brown grasses, dotted everywhere with tiny yellow dark-centred sunflowers, and bearing as its outposts now and then, distinct against the horizon, the low- set shanties of the hrst corners. Miles on miles to the right, to the left, before, behind, the yellow brown country roUed away, the blue dôme of the sky springing from ail its outskirts, the fibrous grasses paling in the swathe of the strong wind. Hère and there a reedy little pond lay on it like a pocket looking-glass, with a score or so of wild duck swimming over it ; or a slight round hollow where a pond used to be with the wild duck flying high. The railway with its two lessening parallel straight lines seemed to lead from intinity to infinity. Straight into the west we went, chasing the sun, who laughed gloriously at us and mocked us with a lengthening^hadow, fleet as we were. The sand and cinders that rose in the wake of the flying train began to accumulate in our eyes and to obscure the view, however, and we went in after a while. So did the other ré-trospective lafly a little later,and came and sat opposite us. Ortho- docia looked \"^t me, and hunted for a minute in jiejr hand-hag. I \u003c* Orthodocia i«a little short-sighted. ' Tf you hâve a cinder in your eye, hère is an eye-stone,' said",

The lady thanked her, and said that it wasn't a cinder, and then Orthodocia was sorrj she had not looked more carefully, for there was only one other explanation of things. So she offered a tailway novel by way of réparation, and subsided into one herself, but that was the begiuning of their acquaintance. I looked up and observed that our companion was an Englishwomah, but evidently |bocustomed to the country. One kiiew the first from her speech, and the second frora an indescribable something in the way she wore her clothes. She had lost most of her EngHsh colour, though a little of it lingered yet, dar^ned into lines and patches, and her face had grown tense instead^sof t as it was intended to be. She did not look*unhealthy, but there was something in her alert Americanised air that suggested heavy drafts on her reserve fund of vitahty. She was not pathetic- ally shabby — people seldom are in America — but there was a very much ' made over ' look about her, and a quarter of an inch of useless kid flapped at each finger-end of her two-buttpn black gloves. I suppose she might hâve been fifty. The first time I came out of my pirated édition of ' Robert Els- mere ' they were finding out peo-ple they both knew in Englaud. The next time the other lady had disôlosed the fact that she was a nièce of Orthodocia's dear bishop. The next time Orthodocia was being enlightened as to the expériences of Ehglish ladies who emi- grate with their husbands to farm the Canadian North-West, and I listened.

Before that there seems always an un- rest about it, a vague undulation of Une along the sky, the con-tour of the country never broken, but always gently changing with Il *^« PO^»* of View, like the bounds of truth as we know them. But hère the country might hâve been ironed out ; it lies without a wrinkle or a fold, flat to its utmost verge. The town strays this way and that, like a cobweb ; you can see above it, around it,'î^rougli it, across levels and levels beyond. The.world looks very clean- washed about Corona— to keep iny metaphor in the laundry. The tiny log-houses one descries at great intervais in a prairie drive are more specks on its wide surface. And the air finds the bottofc of one's lungs in such a searching tonio way, giving one such hopeful notions of things in gênerai, that one is disposed to think that even noisome humanity, planted out hère, has a chance of cotaing up with fewer weeds in it than are common to the crop. I hâve met very few people in England who did not know of some- body in Canada.

Shethought hle Vas ranching in Winnipeg, until we got to Winnipeg and she dis- çovèred that people didn't ranjch there to aAy extent^ on account of ttie priée of city lots for pastiire. Then Orthodocia gave him up. l| don't think she was very anxious to see him. She believed he had bben in the country three years, and didn't know ' what connections ' h^ might hâve made. And neither of us had the least idea, when a nicktie-less, heavy-coated, high-booted young man, bronzed and deep\" cljested and muscular, came and sat opposite us at the dinner table ofiCorona's pleasant little hôtel, that it could be Orthodocia's second coUin in the flesh. In fact, we thought.very little about him, except thàt he had a large quantity of mud on his boots, end nervously ofitred us a great maçy unnecessary things. At last, however, when Orthodocia had declined the Worcestershire sauce for thethird time, he put down his knife and fork with an air of desperation, and said, « I find among the new arrivais in the hôtel register thé name Miss Orthodocia Love, of England, and as there are no other ladies in the hôtel, I think one of y ou must be my cousin. It is not Or— a common )iame.' Now, I hâve no doubt that you are inwardly believing this cousm to be an invention, and my dignity as a self^respecting his- tonan^will not permit me to deny this. But you would not hâve thonght so if you could hâve seen the véhément manner in which those two Loves shook hands with one another, and watched the patheticway in which the exiled Love's gravy ohiUed into greasiness, while.he absorbed Orthodocia's English colour instead of his proper * nutriment, and hung with many ' I saya !

He only laughed uneasily, and said that, well, his advice to us was to hâve nothing whatever to do with any- body, advice which, I niight as well confess in the beginning, we scrupulously disregarded. ' If you wouldii't mind a twenty-mile drive each way,' he said, after a while, ponderingly, ' I could take you out to my place to- night and get you back to-morrow. I could borrow the aunt of a fellow about five miles off for the occasion, and I dare say he'd be glad enough to corne over too. He never sees an^body besides the fellows but his aunt— nice old girl, but rather deaf and not lively. ^'liat do you think î It would be roughing it, you know ! ' Orthodocia assented joyfuUy, and then added, in some trépi-dation, ' You are sure of the aunt ? ' -_ ' If she'a alive,' responded Mr. Jack Love with enthusiasm. . ' She was lent once before not long ago, for a dance, and she rather liked it.' •\u003e So it happened that within an hour we were breasting the yigor- ous North- West air as it came roUing in over the great stretches of the prairie, billow after billow of it, behind Mr. Jack Love's • team ' of little bronchos, Orthodocia, trying to hold them in, sitting up very straight as she would in her own dog-cart in the Park, and makirig, withlier cheeks aflame and her fur collar tumed up agaihst them, as pretty a picture as you could imagine. Our vehicle was, in the lan- \"guage of the country, a ' democrat,' a high four-wheeîèd cart, painted and varnished, with double seats, one behind the other. Mr. Jack sat beside Orthodocia to supplément her very limited acquaintance with bronchos, and I shared the seat behind the two Loves with a large bundle of binding twine and certain sections of agricultural implements brought in for repairs. The road lay across the prairie — iike a yeat)tt»dulaltitg,velvety\"black«iflke the original IndiajL trail, Mr. Love told us, curving to avoid the swampy places.

So we went ; speeding over a world with nobody in it but ourselves for miles at a time. In fact, we saw only three people ail the way. One was a pleasant^faced German driving a pair of oxen, who suggested to Mr. Love certain liearty words of appréciation. * That fellow,' he said, « and bis family represent more success than anybody I could show I you within fifty mileà. Everything they can't ,raise or make they do without, as far as possible, spending less moneyin a year than some of the rest of us, who think ourselves some on economy, do in a week. Their furniture they make of wood from the bluffs— even the nails are hardwood pins. They stuff their beds with wild dried hay, weave their blankets, spin their clothes, produce their bread, and imagine their luxuries ! ' Quaint, durabl^î^tic home-màking this, we thought. No varuish, no veneer, ail primitive but con- çcientious, good outward showing of the inward Teuton. We looked back after the man with admiration. • Yes,' assented Mr. Jack, «it's ail true, but I can't help getting into a wax with those Deutschers sometimes in my mind. They're j so — damed — contented ! ' Which showed two things— first, that Mr. John Love's vocabu- lary had not quite escaped American contamination ; second, that he had not been three years in Assiniboia without ocottsional fits of home-siekness.

He had an honest, sun-burned face, and great knotty red bands. He wore a grey flannel shirt, and his blue jean trousers were hitched to his shoulders by one old white slispender and a pièce of rope. Jack Love had 'boarded' with Jim on his Ontario farm, and probably paid hira five dollars a we^k for a year ' tOybe instructed in gênerai agrijulture.

It was about six feet by ten, and had one small square window wearing a demoralised muslin âounce. A little iron bed with several blue blankets orxM, filled up one end, and there was a table wi^ a pitcher and basin, a fragment of looking-glass, and a collection of old pipes on it, and a chair. Two or three rifles stood in one corner. The çuter walls were roughly boàrded over, a«xd between the cracks of the partitioi) dividii)g^this from the ' settin-room ' we could see the pattern of the pink jàlid green wall-paper with which Mr. John Love had made that apart{nent cheerf ul.

' \" It did not take long to explore Mr. Love's establishment very l'thoroughly. There were three cane-bottomed chairs in the salon Iwith the pink and green waJl-paper, and a tablé with a miscellaneous jliterary collection on it. A Christina Rossetti Birthday Book, from 1 ' his loving sister on the eve of his departure for America,' Somebody on Shorthoms, a welF-thumbed set of Dickens, ' The Game of Cricket,' ' Successful JMen,' some old àchool books, and a lot of railway novels, in which a certain prominence wasgiven to the worksof Miss Amëlie I Rives. Décoration had stopped at the wall-paper, but a couple of polished buflîilo horns made pegs for rather bad hats. Thé floor was covered with a rag carpet, there were some skins about, and a gor- geous nickel-plated cylihdrical American coal stove upreared itself in the middle of the room, and sent at least two yards of stove-pipe straight through the roof. We foUowed our noses with great pre- [cision into the kitchen, where Jim was bending over a dihiinutive Icook-stove, his countenance warmed into a deep rose madder, cooking jwhat seemed to us a feast for the gods in a frying-pan. It was only j bacon, and I dare say the smell would not hâve been tolerated for an instant on Olympus, even about the back premises ; but we had achieved a pair of North- West a^spetites, and régarded Jim tenderly. He had set the table elaborately in one corner, coveriug it with a jfaded pièce of flowered chintz, that fell in voluminous folds to the I floor. With an eye to neatness as well as ehîgance, Jim had pinned it up at the corners, so that it looked very like the garment of a corpulent washerwoman. We speculated in vain, but feared to in- quire what the origiïîkl uses of that flowered chintz raîght hftve been.

Our seats were also placed, five wooden chairs and a turned- up tub, but the tub concealed ■ itself modestly in an in- side corner under the chintz— Jim*was evi- dently a strategist.

Then we went forth in à jbody to see what might be seeA— the men's quarters, with their long [rdws of narrow grey-blanketed'beds, the tiny théâtre which was also ta chapel on occasion, the canteen where a fresh-coloured little jwoman dispensed sardines and biscuits and ginger aie to ail the jbarracks, and the wooden-grated guard-room, where, for the moment, Ithere was nobody but the guard and a foolish old Indian who lay llikû on© dead in « luï*ipy^ heap tmdei-his blanket.

They told us of him again in a narrow and enclosed court at the back of the prison, where we looked up, with a sudden chill, at a certain window above. He stepped out to the hangman, who helda gryd.^e agamat him, from that window. And I remembered the suu licrht- mg uïj some marigolds on a quiet grave in sleepy St. Boniface, across the river from Winnipeg, within a stone's throw of a quaint old convent where a thfifty Sister Adiposa was stoopingover some cab bages in the garden. It was not yet quite time for High Mass, and a few French half-breeds, the men in mocassins, the women with the tête couverte, loitered about the gâte and the church-door. Tho grave had been made for their sakes. but none of them went near it-it had lost mterest for them since the sod grew.

As we approached he put down the -buckets, one on each side of him and saluted the Major. Jack gave Orthodocia a cousinly nudge,*and as she looked agam the man started, tUrned the colour of old red sand- stone, then stood very erectly as before, and saluted again.

Orthodocia raised her hands in admira-tion, a^d began to quote something.

I found the towel thowgh, which was of more conséquence at the time ; ând thenwe bôth hurried foi^th upon the swaying reâr platform of the csfc to join oar exclamations with those of a fel^ow-passenger, whom we ëasily recôgnised to be the mari irom Little Rock, 'Arkatisaw.'''^^\" ^ As we stood there on the end of the tear and looked out at the grèatj amphithéâtre, with the mountains' sitting soletu^nly aroun'4 it, re'gard- ing our impudent noisy toy of steam and whéels, we remembered that we should see mountains with towers and minarets — mountains like churches, like fortifications, like cities, like clouds.

In Orthodocia's notebook he figures as the eleventh bear we experienced in the Rockies : but this being a sober chronicle I prefer to gives its readers what might be called the benefit o£ the doubt. Next morning we sallied forth to climb the Glacier. We took a âmall boy as a mère formality on account of the bears, but we found him useful before long on other accounts. For, while horses and mules are promised to convey the tourist of next year to the base of the phenomenon aforesaid, the tourists of last year had to walk ; and the walk is a two-mile climb, more properly, over rocks, across (by stepping-stones) thfe torrent that the sun seuds down from the Glacier every day, and under Douglas firs that towei? «eventy feet above you, with the sunlight filtering down through them upon mosses that are more vividly, vitally green than anythingl eversaw out of British Columbia. The grimy small boy's grimy small hand as he skipped from rock to rock over the c[e»^, green water that swirled past them, was an invaluable membé'r. A small dpg was attached, necessarily, I suppose, to the sms^iîie^— l|tfi alarwist taiall dog, who persisted in making wild excur^^îii^'îpt\u003c|'^e forest, bark- ing volubly inthe distance, and adding péttâ,^/\"bears to Ortho-docia's note-bool£.

We maintained our purpose of climbing the Glacier with thè utmost steadfastness the whole way. In fact^ we took it,for grantéd that we should get to the top in the course of the morning — that ever^body did;— so confidently that we didn't think it necessary to mention the matter to the small boy until we were almost thera The manner in which he received our intention was not encoura»- ing.

Its wavelike Utile hoUows were slippei^ and ankle-breaking, and great cracks yawned through it suggestively, On close inspection it was a very dirty Glacier indeed, to look so vast and white and awful a little way oflF, though the torrent that gushed frpm its feet down through thç valley to the canyon of tB^p^er was clear as crystal. Being athirst, we wanted to drink the glacier water, but bhe small- boy, for whom we were beginning to acquire a prodigious respect, would not permit this. ' Snow- water,' he said, would give us fever-we must find a spring. Then we entered, and sat down in a beautiful blue ice-cave under the Glacier, fell into the usual raptures an ice-cave iiispires, and took two bad colds which lasted longer.

Remonstrances were useless at that point, however, se I retired with Ibe air of a person who washes her handp of it. Later, when I had brought myself to the point of referring to the subject again, I said to Orthodocia ' My clear Junatic, how much has that sharper induced you to throw away m town lots î ' or words to that effect.

' Hurry ! ' said Orthodocia, ' or it will be piwh dark when we get th^re, and our Japanese is not fluent.' We were going to Tokio. Now it does not particularly matter when one goes to Tokio from Yokohama. If it is advisable to go at one, and lunch is late, why, say two ; if at two one's gloves are missing, three will do ; if somebody calls at about that time there is no reason why one should not got at four. We had begun to go to Tokio, for example, when I became pencil smitten of those clustering eaves two houràbefore, and our various portmanteaux were ^till lyin\u003cr restfuUy on the verandah beside us. ' What if it is ! ' l responded, indicating a chiraney, 'you forget that they ail speak English ! ' It was fur second day^in Japan, and as we had been advised not to spoîl the freshness of our impressions by seeing Europcanised Yokohama, we had not seen it, but had devoted ourentire attention U\u003e recovering from the Pacific and the reporter. Our acquaint- anee.with the natives of that remarkable and interesting country had been limited, therefore, to the opportunities of the very Europeato hosteiry I Iwve mentioned. j^ 'I don't know,' said*.Orthodocia,^kghtfuliy, «you can't believe ' everythii^ you read.

I made him understand,' as he apologetic- ally got up and went out. ' Nothing like bçing plain and forcible with the heathen intellect ! ' Buddha reappeared prçsently with his arms fuU of wood and a fan. Then we observed that the fire had taken advantasre of our excitement to go out. The wood was neatly arranged in bundles fifteen inches long an^ eight thick. You could hold five of the logs on your outstretched palm without dropping a splinter. The fan had a young moon in one corner, some clouds having been spilled on the samé side. Buddha put two pièces of wood in tte stove, lighted chem with some kindling exactly the size and shape of visiting cards, which he took from his sleeve, sat down in front of it, and fanned it with a grâce that might hâve been the resuit of a long ball-room expérience. Then he turned c\u0026Jjmly about on his heels and said, with the air of one who makes a humble suggestion, ' Chow now î ' Buddha's vocabulary, as we learned afterward, was beautiful in its simplicity and wonderful in ils expressiveness. It consisted in little more than the single term, affirmatively, negatively, and inter- rogatively applied, * Ghow now.' Chow thèn by ail means we said, and while we waited for it Orthodocia recklcsslypiled our entire provision of fuel for the winter into the stove ,at once. Our fqpiLive board appeared on a tray, borne by the faithful Buddha, and followed by Kiku, and Toiiii, and Jokichi, and the others in a line to the vanishing point, each with a small black lacquered bowl covered by a saucer to correspond on another tray. Buddha went down ou his knees, and so did the sub-commissioners. He presented us each with a shiny red wooden vessel and a pair of chop sticks. Removing the lid we discovered rice. I prefer to make a hiatus hère in my description, which you raay fill in with the chop-sticks.- I hope you will not find it as difficult în imagination as we did in fact.

After our fruitless struggle with thèse implemerrts our attentif was invited to ex- tremely minute cups of pale green tea, accompanied by red and white . sugar bubbles, which melted away in our mouths ieaving an im-pression of the family medicine chest. Bowls of soup with fish in it followed. The fish we speared very elegantly with our chop-sticks, the soup we were reluctantly compelled to drink. Then came pièces of a fowl that never flew on sea or land, with preserved cherries and sugared beans. Sheets of pale green sea- weed formed the next course. Then Ûmp and cold and flabby, hberally dosftd with pungent brown soy, the Japanese pièce de ré- nstame. We found the rest of it in the kitchen afterward, looking very uncomfortable in a pail of water, and astonished Buddha by requesting that it should be killed and boUed for the next meal. He is probably stiU contemptuous of the foreign taste which prefers dead fish, A délicate pink saucer Was then presented to us, containing round shces of lilac-coloured vegetable matter with holes in it-the root of the lotus. It had a rubber consistency in the hand, and a soapy suggestion in the mouth. ' Lovely culinary conception ! ' said Orthp- docia, ' take it away ! ' And we decided that we did not care for boiled poetry. We paused at the lotus. It had seemed a lengthy and elaborate repast, and yet we were consciouB of a sensé of incompleteness, a vagrant and uncared for gastronomie feeUng. We remembered a beautiful pièce of scenery near the Seyo Ken restau^nt, and went for a walk.

         ".Vjî-\u003e:^ 92 A SOCIAL DEPARTURE s\\ should hâve bçen the case. It would hâve been ' something,' as Orthodocia mourned to me one day, to be able to confront that in-stitution with a practical, working, world-acquired knowledge of the antécédents of ail the facts exposed to public ignorance in its glass cases. That struck me as ambitious. Whpn, however, not long ago, in the course of some peaceful cups of tea, a certain impressive dame fixed me with her glassy eye, and asked me the number of cubic feet in the Pyramid of Cheops, and whether it was true that the Israélites built it, I confess that I should like to hâve knowu, just to hâve been able to suppress her polite inquiry as to what we went round the world fw ! I was obliged to saj then, as I am obliged to say now, that we went chiefly to be amused, which pro- bably would not hâve been — elaborate sarcasm — her object ; an aim which you may find as unsatisfactory as she did. Perhaps, though, if we had stayed in the housè and studied the Japanese classics, we might hâve missed a sunset from the hill of Kudan ; if we had devoted more time to Shintoism we might not hâve gone to Mr. Takayanagi's garden party, and Mr. Takayanagi's garden party— but I anticipate. We had been keeping house in Kudan in unalloyed felicity for two days. By shutting ourselves up in them by mistake, and taking down the wall on the other side, we had discovered most of ourcup- boards. We had learned to sit upon flat square velvet cushions in the middle of thefloor, admire our painted hermit and our single vase, and congratulate ourselves on the convenience of the Japanese f umiture idea which, leaving nothing to be possessed, leaves nothin» to be desired. Dignities and classifications in the matter of our apartments were purely arbitrary. The sideboard and the dining- table and the piano being a-wanting, and the bed and toilet ar-rangements put securely away in the wall, we might sleep in the dining roora, dine in the sahn^ and receive in the bedroom with equal cDmfort and propi;iety. Our house did its whole duty in en- couraging a taste for simplicity and keeping the rain out. It must be confessed that this palled upon us in the course of time, and I remember Orthodoci» declaring one day that she teok^an itttdleotuat ^ comfort outof the bath-room which ail the décorative essences of the six foot drawing-room did not aObrd, on account of its distinct",
         "local î I OUR JOURNEY ROUND THE WORLD 93 peculiarity— which consisted in the bath. I must be allowed to wander still further while I describe that bath-ioom. You hâve nothing at ail like it in England. It opened ofiF the drawing-room, to begin with, which is some- what unusual, and 'gave ' on the back'yard. Considering the ab-sence of glass and shutter, it gave immoderately on the back yard. Tt was pfotected from the winds of heaven by little wooden bars a few inches apart, and a paper pane that slid over thèse. One re- quired a chair to climb. into the bath, which was an imposing struc-ture, as they say of municipal buildings in Western America, some- thing like a wood box, with a funnel at one end for charcoal, to beat the water. We no sooner saw this reniarkable contrivance than we were seized with a simultanèous yearning to get into it. But we had not read Miss Bird for nothing— how the Japanese made an elaborate cérémonial of the bath, each entering it in turn, but the most honourable first and we had pledged ourselves, on artistic grounds, to be as Japanese as possible. We produced towels at tlie same moment and then looked at each other. ' You first ! ' said I, politely, bowing and drawing my breath in between my teeth in a manner that would hâve graced the Court, of the Mikado. f' ^ ' ÂTprh vous / ' retunied Orthodocia, with the same étiquette, in- dicating the bath-room vith a stately wave of her towels. But I would not be constrained, and after a while Orthodocia, feeling un- equal to further politene^g on muscular grounds, went to order her bath. The commotion that immediately followed showed us that we had laid no light command on our household. Préparation was to be made for a function. Our retinue received the order with be- coming décorum on their knees, and conversed upon the subject of it in awed tones in the kitchen. Then one by ono its members filed \" into the bath-room with pails and pitchers and baraboo dippers, and cups and teapots fuU of water, which they emptied in solemn con-clave into the bath. Issued \\oTth Buddha, of serene countenance, went on ail-fours to Orthodocia, andtouched the floor with his fore- i\u003eead. — - - fi; 'Get up, Budtiha,' said Orthodocia, amiably. ♦ What do you ' want î ' \u003c 1 If i •iàM-'ii'i.x",

' You éhould never argue with servants about thèse things,' she remarked to me. And he took coal.; I sup^se it was three-quarters of an hour after this command was issujid that I heard my name from the bath-room in accents of the Uveïiest distress, alternating with high-pitched commands of ' Ikem^Jio / ' 3 I thought, as I sat down near the top of the stairs and de^cended them in my hurry in this manner, of the storiesl had heardôf the Japanese climate sending people mad, and Ihoped that my fi^end's would be only a temporary aberration. The mère men-tion 0f what I saw when I got down ig enough to bring on strained relations between Orthodocia and me to this day. I don't at ail know what she wiU say when she sees it in print. Thin curls of smoTce wefe issuing from behind the closed paper panels of the bath- room, and before them knelt our whole retinue, attracted by the v^uble anguish within, each with one eye immovably glued to the s^all round hole which he or she had made with a wet finger for jiurposes of observation ; and my unhappy friend told me afterwards that the jmnkisha man was at the window. Ah she heard me .commg, Orthodocia's plaints grew louder. 'The water is nearly boihng 1 ' she wailed. ' They won't ikenuisho, and I can't get out tiU they do ! And there's something the matter with the chimney , of this bath-it smokes ! And there's no way of tuming the heat off ! Ah-ow I ' Convulsive splashings, and wilder cries of ' Will you ikemasho !

As to who Taka)|anagi-san might be, or where his house was, or what was going to hiappen in it, not â, syllable of light could Buddha afford us, though wd plied him diligently. So there we were in the enviable position of peing invited to a delightful Japanese something, we knew not wAat, we knew not when, we knew not where. Orthodocia sat dowi^ and tore her hair. Suddenly inspiration da^^ned in Buddha's countenance, ' Skoshi maté ! ' ' said he, and presently we saw him whirling violently down the hill of Ku4an.in a jinrikisha.

Mr. Takayanagi had learned of our récent arrivai • from America in the newspaper, and as his garden party was given in honouf of his two sons also recently arriyed from collège iij America, hethought it appropria'te to invite us therfeto.

On one occa-sion, while Orthodocia was doing her best to converse with a yourig gentlemau in tennis sHbes, a silk hat, and a dressing-jacket, and I talked to another in tails and a 'Tarn O'Shanter,' one of the voung Takayanagis bore down upon us with still another, in irreproachable evening dress, lavender kids, patent leather shoes, white tie and ail — and garnished as to his neck with a large, flutfy, comfortable Manchester bath towel, best quality ! I suppose the gentleman had a cold. But the gentle, unconscious, unol)serving unaniniity with which Orthodocia and I moved ofl' in diderent directions at that moment was a beautiful sight to see. Mr, Takashi Takayanagi cçillt^ fided to me his regrei that tluire were no Japanése ladies présent in foreign dress, and 1 think he was astonished at the vigour of the sentiments I exprecsed upon the subject. As the Sun went down, and made a clieckcring of quaint sliadows ail among the smiling, moving, bowing little groups about us, a fcast was disclosed behind the tallest of the mountains, and under the most umbrageous of the fir trees — a very vitonderful feast of which I hâve still a souvenir in a large smooth shell of the clam variety. I ate sugared beans from this with chop-sticks, and carried the dish and the remaius, for many sugared beans are a weàriness to the flcsh, home with me for politeness' sake. ' - And then, leaviug the garden party of Mr. Takayanagi still elaborately complimenting itself among the chrysanthemums, we rode away out through the wide gâte into the life and light and colour of Tokio's early evening. In my picture of it, which grows more like a phantasm every day, the great daintily-tinted paper globes were pulsing and glowing before the multitudinous little shops ; the gay drops of light that liung from the jinrikishas were frisking up hill and down ; there wm still a red mémory of the sun in the sky behind the dragon-like omis of the gnarled pino trees that guard the Mikado's moat ; and against thèse three wild geese were flying, black and swift, long necks outstretched in front, short Içgs out- stretched behind, just as they flew always across a tea-tray, that I khew long before I ,went to Japan. And, high over ail, on ita i. pyramid of stoncs, shone the great square lanteru of Kudan— dusky,",

Not so much as an ivory hairpin re- mained to tell of the shy little maids, nor a cuff-button to re- mind us of the quaint little men, nor a scrap of tinted paper to be a memory of ail the pretty doings we had seen. The fantastic narrow walks were immacu- lately neat. In one of them a gardener was carefully pick- ing up pine-nee\u003clles, and I havè no doubt that the bridges and - shrines and embank- ments had every one been dusted that moming. But it ail looked unreasonable and expressionless, like a Japanese arawing, and there was not any- where a lingering sniile of the charm we had found so very cliarming in Mr. Takayanagi's garden party.

And he marshalled us, if the wom is not too big for the occasion, into another room. It seemed so full of softly chattering little dames in wonderful clothes and painted faces and shiny black pufls, that must hâve been lacquered over-night to be so sniooth and solid, that I wondered how Orthodocia could ever get into it. When she did, and stood in their nudst, graceful and tall and fair, with whîte chrysanth\u003c)imums in her \\ bosom and a look of quiet wonder in her face, a sudden silence fell upon ail the little ladies, and they regarded her, my beautiful English friend, with a certain pathetic perception, I thought, of the distence that lay between her and them. How we marvelled what they had been talking about when we came in, thèse soft-voiced matrons who so suddenly found themselves with nothing to say ! Not the opéra, surely, for the opéra in Japan is-well, is not a thing that is calculated to excite conversation. Not their pet charities, for the ladies of Japan whp are advanced to committee meetings wear bonnets and boots. Could it hâve been ' scandai, or servants, or the weather, or those curious little shaven dolls that reprcFonted babies to them î We could not guess, and nobody tokl us.

Ouf host's art treasurés wtjre brought out of thej,r hidden places for thej pleasure of his guests ; not ail at once with vulgar lâvish- ness, b^t one or two at a time, to be handled tenderly and a^iir- ingly, ind appreciated separatêly in daiiity phrases. We 1)?«ndered at tho discrimination of tlie little ladies, and felt niost diMéy and bunglihg and unclever when ouf turn came to toueh and tof^ise the ivory carvings and the inlaid bronzes, and the tbiy soft old pbrcelain bowls and vases. Mr. Jokichi Tomita listened with quiet pîty g^ we stunibled on, missing »lways the wo/iderful curve or the rare colour, and bowed polite acknowledgment of our good intentions, only saying, as he replaced his joys in their sandalwood cabinets, ' The foreign taste, I think it is much diflTérent \\Vith ours. The Japanese child— sniuU baby — is wiçe in thèse things.' ,^. About this time dinner was announced, tttat w to say, a wall vanished suddenly, and showed a small empty room with about a dozen f|at velvet cushions in a row upon the floor. Nothing else. Orthodocia and I looked at one another, and I think the Ru^sian a«ac/i\u003cf crossed our minds at the same moment. Mentally we com- miserated, not ourselves, of course, but one another I Then came the uuhappy moment wheii we were waved to the first cushions in the row, as the honoured guests of the occasion, and expected*to sit down on them in fuU view of the demure little company. We stood over them as long as we could, but it became apparent that so long as we remained standing tliere was a hitch in the ceremony ; so we gradually subsided upon^them, the most unearthlygroans arising from ail parts of Orthodocia's attire at once. « I shiiU never get up,' she whispered to me, ' without a derrick,' and at that instant I heard the bitter sound of parting lacep that proceeds only from a sylph- like form undor stress of circurastances. Then began aaiong the little ladies an odd strug^de, not fôrprece- dence, but for post-'cedence. The most rigid order was obsorved, and they ail knew that it must be, yet it would hâve been a horrible rude- ^ess to take the next most Ijonourablê cushioii, or the nèxt, or tlîff /- next, without a great show of déférence to somebody imaginarily more w si ^ w y« Je yo gn th\u003c cre ' gin per whj Lat aid as t fore coui pass mit^ whei garl; self One' turp\u003c ever, and trays hot Ml ours- bowii in ret",

It was.conducted upon Europèan pnnciples, but its conductors were not Europeans, and the principlcs seemed to work erratically, as if they did not feel at home The bazaarwasheldin a building put ,up by the paternal Japanese Government to fostier social intercourse among the pfficial classes on the Europèan plan-to be a club-house in short. It was the advanced idea of a certain foreign minister, who retûrned from spécial pleni poing somewhere in Europe with the opinion that his countrymen sat down too much in the evenings. The Government, therefore bui t upon foreign plans, a place of resort for them, in wHich they cou d be induced, among other things, to stand up ; and put billiard- tables in it for muscular development, and a bar, doubtless to sti- mulate circulation. I regret thaï I cannot, give you the figures of the mental, moral, and physica^ improvement that immediately fo lowed. Orthodocia tried to get them, but they had not yet been tabulated. I cannot say positively that the Mikado and his advisers had anything further to do with the aO^iir than granting the use of thè premises, but that bazaar certainly seemed directly under the super vision and control of the State Department. We passed thr6u\u003clh a double file of solemn-faced little policemen to the door, and there met an officiai who took our tickets as if he would hâve preferred a cer tihcate of character attached. One gets in the -way, in Japan of trembling before the least of uniforms, they take their gold kce so senously and wear the little shining chrysanthemura of their emperor with such a redoubtable air of authority.

If it had not been for the sentry we migiit hâve crossed one of the arched wooden brid-^^s and entered privily the seat of the In.perial representati^■e of \"thé . gods of Japan.

I believe, on account of thé conservative nature of his tastes, but now that he had begun there was no rea«on why he might not conciliate his advisers by going on indefinitely. His habit had been, up to that time, to appoint a date with vague amia- bihty some distance off, settle down on his tatami to the solid com- fortsof hfe tilUhe date came round, and then obi igingly reappoint rt.

Being a Mikado he ..^, feels h.mself superior to the fashions.

The air is full of stories, told by Europeans rbut they bear -their own stamp of ^unvçracity ; and the Japa.nese'tliemselvesprotect . their sensitiveness about their Mikado's moral and intellectual ■ stature by a lacquer of polite ignorance. To queries as to his ih- terest^, his aims, his occupations, they hâve only one answer, usually accompanied by a shrug, which is not qnite discreet-' J/a/taW- - rnusen / '_« I hâve not the slightest idea ! ' So between the préjudice of its guests and the pride of ite subjects, the gold chrysanthemum is very well protected from any trial by tire, and glitters before the world . with ail the virtues of true Impérial métal taken for granted. Orthodoca has a photograph of the gentleman in question, however Jand I mean toborrqw it for Mr. Townscnd to make a picture gf' Ihen you will see for yourself that he looks more like the subtrac-tion of the grâces than the sum of the virtues. As you hâve perhaps gathered from thèse pages aforetime, the Japanese idea çf household décoration does not admit of much varietv and rt ,s not s*-prising to find the only différence between the rqpm s of the Emperor and Empress and tjpse of their well-to-do subjects to be an added fineness of texture tnà richness of lustre and .^race ot line. Thfr,same paper panels for walJs, the sarae dainty alcôves the same polished tree^,trunks for division, the same suggestion of colour and curve for beâut\u003e{ in th«se rooras of the twelve ladies-in waiting as in the hôuse of a servant of the Government at fifteen hundred a year. Of\\ course the glittering birds flashing in and out of dark storm-clouds on the wall are pure gold, and designed by . an, artist who is much more than the William Morris of Japan but there the distinction ends.

It was a feast for the gods of Japan ; a«fd jolly Dai-koku himself could not hâve wished |br better\" âpîriits than it brought. / After breakfast -«^e walked out of our inheÉpitable little front gâtes to find an extraordihary gro^th on each side of it not bargained for wilh our landlord. It shot ttraight and stiffly up out of the ground about four feet, and consisted of a busliy bunch of pine branches and three sections of green bamboo. We had stopped ^giving way to astonishmènt in Japan, finding that it made toamuch of a demand upon ou'r tirae ; so we simply contemplated this addi-tion to the scenery abbut our résidence, and asked Buddha if it had corne to stay. As we e'xpected, Buddha was responsible for/it. Buddha was responsible for everything, from the Japanese cat with- out a tail, that made liight hideous for a weet, and took no notiCQ whatever of her proper name, but answered ±o a chirrup and made incompréhensible remarks, and was an idolater, to the hanffinjr of a arge soap advertisement in our small salon under the impression that it WittJ a masterpiece of foreign art. We looked to him, there- fore, for the generfil explanation of'our dômestic matters. And Buddha gave us to understand, with ■ the assistanc|?!ii)f an old American almanack, that it devdlved upon us as temporary citizens of Tokio to decôl-ate for the New Year as the custom was. He had bought and plaj^ted the décorations, trusting to our sensé of our re- , sponsibilities for justj^cation,and it was not withheld. We sped away through the city in o^r jinrikishas with that comfortable sensé of duty done that prédisposes one to the scrutiny of other people's behavio«r. But we found Tokio ready for it. No- body liad quite forgotten to welconje the New Year, howeyer tiny the bird-cage tiwelling over which it would dawn for him. His tiled roof might be suuken' and his papfer panes ragged andv black, but over the door surely waved a few palnietto fronds with a (pit of white paper fluttering among them, if nothing else ; and his ivoryjidded babies, crowing and totteriiig in the street exactly as you mi|i^t éxpëct à Japanese Joli to crow anJ tottêr, fooked up at them with sliarp beady anticipation in their little black eyes.

And, as we were comparing conclusions about the plum cake, the House having gone into Supply, there came a box.

We lifted the cover rapturously, and it dis-, closed two dozen of as neat little brown eggs, each reposing on its . sawdust cushion, as ever entered a larder of civilisation.

Each smoôth little oval had a separate charni for us ; it appealed directly to our housekeeping susceptibilities ; it seemed to till a long-felt want as nothing in the way of a présenta-tion ever had before. We had been told that it was the custom of people who receîvod several thousand eggs annually to send them forth again on their errand of congratulation and potential omelets ; aiul we had heard of a gentleman who marked one of his eggs for future' référence, and had the sclfsame egg returned to him after many diiys - tradition says the ncxt New Year. v^rthodocia said that she did not believe this egg story ; but we thought we would not be graceless about our eggs and redistribute them, but grateful and sciamble them. / Re-eutered Buddha with another njystery.

That night Tokio went tipsy. It was a gentle glowing tipsiness, that shook and swayed and trembled under innuraerable low roofs, over the bare headsof clattering multitudes, aimlessly happy, smiling, bowing, because one always smiles and bows at this especial season ; content to bridge ail the problems of life as they bridged the mod witlj their woodën sandals. Down the long streets miles on miles the paper lanterns shone, bulbous, serene, rows on rows, clusters on clusters, lines of tiny red balls curving far up in air to the top of some aRibitious pôle, great faint yellow orbs, gloweriiig close toearth, globules of light,palpitating, swinging, quivering, in rings ^nd wheels and arches, dainty and wonderful. Don't think of any metropolis you know, blazing with the vulgar va,ri-coloured lanterns that live their short hoiir on the night of a strawherry garden- party. Think of a low, broad, far-stretching city, covered with a tiny heavy-eaved growth of houses that gnomes might hâve built in {lie night, softly illumined from one end to the ofchcr with hundreds of thousands of the palest, mostexquisite ai^d artistic lantern ideas thatever night brought forth. Every tiny intefior opened wide to the womlers of New Year's Eve, the moats shining up at the stars, the young moon sailing high. And the Ginza fair that night ! Where, in ail the gentle lustre of the myriad soft Jights, the sellers sat on the pave-ment in the great street of Tokio with their wares set forth around them, and tempted and chaffered and kughed'! The sellers of tiny earved * «tories — a skele\u003cjpn, a toad-^Hpamboo flûtes, of blue and whit\u0026rice boxes, of long- neck ed «a^t^Rtles and lacquered saki cups, of.tailtwigted bronze candlesticks, of inK'Vellous hair-pins, of cool^iea paniff*^ ' Up and dowîPwê wandered fascinated, wondering what any of our fnends from the Europoan settloment would say if",

Treçs were bolstered up in rice straw— S' not to protect them from the frost, but to \"dry the straw. A husbandman picked his way nimbly aniong his fresh furrow^a whito kerchœf about his head, in blue ' tights ' and loose blue coat, with bags on his ahoulders. Ripe yellow persimmôjis as large as appjes hung amons the leafless twigs. Thq little wihdowless bouses, with their heavy overhanging thatched roofs, looked blind a-nd unintelli- gent ; they did not understand thenj^ires to be llôines, we con- sidered. The colour 'faat inorning was oaiiity and cool, in clear deli- , cate washes of grays and blues, as it miglibJiave corne from a brush in a firm hand for détail. And away oô\", describing a long arc through the fieldlets, and making apparently for a funny little moun- tain tliat stood ail alone in the midst of a wide flatness, shrieked another tiny locomotive, leaving an erratic smoke track along the sky. Many stations, each with its European railway building and its gentle, clattering, staring Japanese crowd, half bareheaded, in kimono and geta^ half in ill-fitting coat and trousers topped by last year's ' Derby ' hats ; and finally^ Utsonoraiya, where we should abandon this foreign innovation of ' steam and wheels, and take ta man-power for the rest of the way. We g\u003ci\u003et out with .car Ttirious bundles, and watched the foreign innovation out qf sight with a strong conviction of its value to the country and tfSe T^aguest idea what to do next. If there is one coaifort in travelling in Japaii, however, it is the mind-reading capacity o(f the Jap\u0026nese. Thpy un ticipate y our idvtui even when you haven't any. Orthodocia drew my attention to this, which I considered unkind— I don't know whether any other observing person bas noted. it or npt. On this occasion they gathered «p our effecis and led us politely into asmall room in the station-house, where they indicated that wè might with propriety sit down.

The sincère pilgrimg to Nikko went in the spring time, and sent up tKeir prayers with the incense of the Avisteria vine. We were very, very late. It was doubtful whether lyeasu would eyten take tlie trouble to feel complimented by our coniiug ; and as to our pétitions it was practically useless to ofler thena at ail at tins timeof the ycar. We had tq seek what consolation we could in long glimpses of the bountry, tli'at slipped away to the right of us, glimpses franied be- 'tîVeen the slanting trunks of the pines, full of tenderautumncolour thoughts, and stretching far to the beautiful blue masses and strange white curves of the snow-tipped mountains tliat held in trust the vénération of ail Japan and thé bones of lyeasu. It is quite true tliat our men ran half the way to Nikko in twb hours and a half without once stopping. ïhen as the evening sky reddened behind the lowfest blanches of the pine trees, we came to' a tea-housp liidden away under them. The walls or the tea-house were open, and tbrough them we saw the fire curling up frora the middle of the earthen floor, and alj the hous*ehold gathered round it. Our runners refreshed theniselves mightily hère, and we ate Vict and eggs, with one battered tin fork between us, and drank hot aèki, and were greatly comforted. Orthodocia confided to me as we started off' again that she didn't know how her runners must feel, ^ut, judging from her own sensations, her jinrikisha was ^tting very, very tired- \\ Then, as we rode on apace, the shadows clûstered and greV between the eaves of the pines, and fell sUently at our féet, though ail about the coiiiitry still lay fair anfl visible in the twilight. Presently they deepened into night, and as we toiled further up, strange dark shapes began to appear between the tr^es and to lejin forward, peering at us — the outer guard of gods about the bone§ of lyeasu. That. evening, as we sat on tlje floor of the Japanese inn and constructed sentences to ask for^ bed in, and soap, and other essen- tials, pur host entered, bowed on bkliands and knees with suprême hunjtîèÉi;:; and made^ remark. • Nanto han(uhimashlta ka?' said Orthodocii /T . ftias ï s ,|",

We renioved it then ; but we could not remove the charcoal fumes, and we dreanied aspliyxia ail night long. In the morning we clapped our hands, and a fat little maiden brought us water in a lacquered bowl, which might hâve held a quart, and tiny blue towels, rather less closely woven tliau cheose cloth, which one rub only reduced tp the consistency of a damp cobweb. She im- plored us ijot to splash the matting or the poetry ou the walls, and then sat dai|m on the floor in an interested way, and watched oùr ' ^cfast, at which our host prpudly prescnted us each { egg— his own poaching— we went to sec the temples, far up the mountain side, the grcaC^eniples, ail clustered together under their curving roofs of rcd aiid gold, witliiu theouter courts of the'trees and the sky. Broad, damp, mo*ssy ,stone steps led to them, and we heard a ceaseless sound of triddiug water fiom the ovcrflowin^ stoiie vessels for the puriHcation of the pilgrims that stood inside the gâtes.

It is our one vivid meniory of the faith of Japaii. We climbed to the tomb of lyeasu, wLbh its bronze lotus and guarding stork; and we looked upon that warrior's helniet, and sword, and chair of state with ail the révérence we could mustcr for heroic annals in Japan. We saw a pale, weird woman, ail in Wa\\ in.^ white draperies with scarlet under them, make strange passes with a fan and a bell-rattle, strange posturinga, strange measured steps in a seniicircle, withia the cell-like little temple where she sat ail day to do her religion this service. And when tliat pale weird woman sat down again among her draperies, and cast ohe leveltook upon us from beneath her lowered lids— a mechnnical, incurious look^we felt that no sum of years, or of miles, or of human dif-férence could avail to express the shivering distance that lay between , her and us. We went back to Utsonomiya in the rain. The long green vista of tWfe leaning pines was darkened and blurred as it stretched out before us in the late afternoon, Orthodocia rode ahead, her jinri- . kisha, with its hood up, looking like a corpulent beetle in fuU scud.

We went from force of habit into some of the sh'ops notwithstanding this, where we saw such a large number of uri- interesting things that Orthodocia, discovering a smali Satsuma dragon in exile in a corner, was moved to tears. After the land of the Mikado, one may encounter the ' commercial temptations of China without fear ; and I write down with considérable and reasonable pride the fact that we escaped with two basket tea-pots apiece only-*-a niere scratch. One buys basket tea-pots in China because there is never any room for them in one's trunk, and they hâve to be carried separately; because the spouts invariably corne off on an unattached journey round the world ; because they are not nearly so pretty as the ex- ported ones ; and because they cost about sixpence apiece less than they do at home. The présent historian was peculiarly fortunate, her spouts having corne off among the vicissitudes of the first five hundred Ailes ; but the expérience of Orthodocia, who preserved one and two-thirds of hers as far as the Suez Canal, and was never happy unless they pointed to the East, ought to be a warning to curio coUectors. We had no Baedeker or any such thing— Orthodocia wouldn't hear of buying one, for fear it might beguile us into staying the necessary week before there would be another P. and O. ship to take us away— but somebody had told us that the proper and usual thing for strangers with a couple of hours in Hong Kong to do was to go up the Peak. Although Orthodocia reminded me that we had not corne to China in search of hacknoyed commonplaces, we also went up the Peak. It was one of the things that we did which convinced us that the travelling public quite understands what it is about, and that the hackneyed commonplace' exista only i i'.' lii tlïè minds of people who stay at home.

I can State this fact confidently, fol- it is down ih Orthodocia's note-book. I remeraber it very well, moreover, because Orthodocia and I enibraced one another fervently several times during the angle of forty-five degrees. She sat opposite me, and it was a matter of necessity. \"^ When we got out we found that a magnificent distance still lay between us and the top. Whereupon four or five Chinamen strolled ' forward and signified, in a desultory way, their connection with thé cable car as a means of transit. They had a sort of legless arra-chai r on two pôles, into which we got amidst much garrulity. One Chinaman arrangea himself between the shafts before,and the other behind. They raised it to their shoulders with several solemn grunts, and presently we started. Orthodocia was distinctly nervous in the cable car, but when angles of forty-five degrees occulred to her arm-chair, she spoke of the strides of mechanicsin themostfeel- ing and intelligent way. ^ We looked away from our feet, there at the top of the Peak of Hong Kong, and our eyes wandered, wavered, lost themselves, and returned helplessly to the familiar grasses beside us. China rolled before us, grim, grotesque, dreary, and silent. Strange hills threw shadows into strange valleys, where no flower grew and no bird san^. The sea, gray on the horizon, thrust dead-white arm^ in betweeij splitary misshapen mountairis, whose gauntness a rag.)ed mist tried vainly to soften. Hong Kong, far below, looked like J pénal settlement f rom the planet we knew before, and its war-ships in the harbourlike the foolish toys of the convictsmade in the-hope of escape. One's eyes dwelt pleasurably on their tennis-pourts, their race-grounds, their green gardens and cherches, and other contrivances to amuse and comfort themselves, for nQwhere else in ail the hem of this strange land's garment could one find a touch of tenderness, a breath of ideality. It was not yielding enough to be raelancholy.^r conscious enough to be grand ; it seemed to be the ^ ^ong-foï^tten Work of the godi of China, as stony, as stolid, a7\" ferocious as they.

Yet it is enough to make every individual on deck exclaim with one émotion, ' India's «oral strand ! ' It's not India, and there's nothing even remoteîy juggestive of a coral strand about it, but ' our imaginations,' as tlie dld lady wlio is aunt to a bishop piously remarks, ' were not given to us for nothing ' ; anfltlie association is well started. She begins by fooking thoughtfufij^or a long time at the geographical suggestion on our lee, a^d i^epéating slowly just as the bishop might hâve douv\u003e: \" ' * From many an ancient river, From many a palmy plain, \" They-«all us'to deliver Tlieir land from error's cliain.' \\m Thovi frhe proposes that we should sing the entire hymn, but somebody-^the 'Second,'! think — hurriedly interpos^g, He déclares it would bo madness to let the association take such obmplete hold on us so early in the trip.

The joke is given to the public simply to show the malign influence of an essentially innocent hymn upon a person who, under other circumstances, had won a réputation for humour. One can't expect Captain Worcester's stçries to 'print' half so funnily as he told them.

He brought down two brace of birds, and sent them , with lively joy to the wife of the agent at Yokohama with a polite ■note; stating that they were the first-fruits of his gun, Meantime the joke w!is explained to him, and he sent in severe spasms of mind to recover tlie crows, instructing his coolie to buy two brace of ducks in the mark et to fulfil the promise of the note. The lady, who had been out, was delighted to receive the note on her return, , and ordered the first-fruits to be brought to her in tlie drawing-roora. ^ There was some delay in executing the order, and apparently some jhsconfusion in the back premises. Presently the tirst-ffltits, lustily pursued and in a state of great excitement, flapped into the room. The coolie had only made the interesting improvement of buying live ones to represent his niastçr's sport, and probably dbes not under- stand the re.ason of his chastisement unto this day. I believe the officer is still in the service. He niust recognise his own ducks very often in the course of a y(?ar.

We advised each other warmly, as we wrung each otiier eut, to travel in future with our luggage in the steam launch. It was pleasant enough, driving about and drying ourselves, and choosing a hôtel, a quaint old castellated-looking affair in a clump of cocoanuts by the sea, about half a mile from the town, which was ail we did^that day. One's first tropical hôtel is always amusing enough to keep bne in it for a while. It took half an hour to appre- ciate the points of our bedroom, with its great windows, opening like shutters on hinges, through which floated the rainy, pattering Sound of the wind-stirred cocoanut palms, and the splash of the waves on the bcach, and the multitudinous cawings of the big black scavenger crows, that flap heavily in themselves occasionally with an eye to booty. We became well acquainted with our crows, and discovered variations in their sage impudence that gave a per- sonality to each of them. The beds are invisible behind their mosquito-nets — not casual draperies such as protect one's slumbers in America, but securely tucked in and guiltless of the smallest hole whatever. The partitions stop within three feet of the ceiling— the terms of rebuke.our neighbour had for his wife on the score of her extravagance were quite embarrassing for Orthodocia and me ; and several times it was a question of debate with us whether we . should rap resonantly upon the wall and say distinctly, 'We're hère !/ The bath is a huge tub that looks as if it might hâve been hollowed out of solid wood, and our ablutions were frequently shared by a small green lizard or so. Beautiful and interesting objects— when one is able to bestow one's entiré attention upon them. The first lizard that occurs in one's bath tub is invariably a scorpion—^ in fact, with Orthodocia the terms were interchangeable — and tins accounts, I daré isay, for the number of scorpions we found in what books on the tropics we had with us.

Among ail thèse the Cingalese waiters move, tall and sinuous and suent, each in his white jacket and flowing nether draperies each with his long sleek, black hair drawn back by a large tortoise- sheU comb. We thought at first that the comb might be an idiosyn- crasy of the hotel-a compulsory measpre adopted for the sake of tliesoup; but we soon discovered it to be a Cingalese masculine vanity of the low country. The Kandyans do not wear combs. and you wdl remember that the British had more difficulty in subduin- them than their low country brethren who were give^ over to the pomps and vanities.

Orthodocia\" and \"lier first mango with en^jitions that timo cannot mitigate. It was a very ripe fat mango, and looked as if it ought to be pë^ed. Orthodocia thought to peel it round and round with precisiofe^ks if it were an apple. At the second round she began to hold it^i^efully over her plalfe ; at the third she tucked her sleeve well u^ î^rdm the wrist ; at the four^ she laid it down blushingly, looked pd^nd carefuUy to see if anyono observed her, made sevenil brilliant maps upon her napkin, ând tacl^led it again. This was too much for the mango, and it bounded with precipitancy into the lap of an elderly person acrossV^ie table,, who restored it with f rigid indignation in a table-spoon. Orthodocia then harpooned it with ■ her fork, and took the rest of the skin off in transversé sections ' which left her in possession of a very large amount of stone with a very superfîcial amount of \"fruit irregularly distributed over it. This she did not consume, having acquired enough mango, as she said, externally. We learned the proper way afterwards, which is to slice the fruit longitudinally into three, leaving a bit of skin at each end of the stone pièce, to takô the pulp out of the sidc slices with a spoon, and to attack the middle sljce with an end in each hand, much in the American manner of consuming gœen corn. This makes the mango unpopuiar as a dessert fruit foi œsthetic reasons and confines its consumption, in fact, with many people who are particular, to the only place which seems to give rooni enouf^h for it and the opportunity of properly repairing its ravages— the raatu- tinal tub.

But where we looked tor Oriental head-dresses there we found bonnet-shapes : where we des.red jewelled daggers, linen cuffs. Plenty of Europeans were chaffenng m the shops, which we did not understand until we were told that thèse native marchants having no high rents and nowages to pay, compete everywhere for British rupees against the British. The soft-voiced, soft-mannered Cingalese with whom we were pre- sently talking, for instance, would make a silk dress for six. while a fashionable oressmaker in the Fort would hâve asked at least twenty- ? u ! ^^\"\"^ «q\"*\"i\"g o'^ the floor of a room behind when we went mto his dark little shop, with two or three fellow seamsters, ail in- dustriously chewing bétel and sewing, one end of the seam neatly held between their large brown toes: -V ' Sala'am !

The same old bell rang every night to warn the taverns and the roystering sailors in them thsjt it was the hour to shut up, in \u003ehose quaint timeS when nobody could Misunderstand the law and a Board of Works was still iniquitously unimagined. And we saw the church itself, built on the. site of its Portuguese predecessor, 'Aqua de.Lupo,' named after it too, in the burly Putch tongue.

This was merciful and fortunate, and made the muttoo 's society infinitely pré-férable to that of the public-spirited citizen whom we had learned to dread. But ho didn't seem, to understand ' Cinnamon Garderts,' either, and at each of our vain répétitions of it he stopped and pointed out another public Building, The situation seemed impos-sible, for there wasn't a white person in sight.

I looked desperately about for means ôf stopping the train, but thei'e were none. The native leaned back and prepared to enjoy himself. We did not kilowthen how sweet a morsel was the topic of the cocoanut tree under the tongueof the dweller in Taprobane. .Itwas not long before we would as soon hâve made a quotation from The Mikado as hâve mentJoned the Cocos nucifera, but this is what he said : • The foUowing are h'only a few of the uses of this invaluable tree. The leaves for roofing, mats, baskets, torches, fuel, brooms, fodder for cattle, manure. The stem of the leaf for fences, yokes for ^xarrying burdens on the shoulders, tishing-rods, and iiinunierable loniestic utensils.

The fibre w\\iich h'envelopes the shell within the h'outer 'usk for mattresses, ckhions, ropes, cables, cordage, cauvas, fishing-nets, fuel, brushes, oakuiV and floor mats. The trunks for raf ters, laths, sailing beats, troughs, Xurniture, firewood, and when very young, the first shoots as a vogemble for the table.'

The shrine was only just visible through the wide iron bars which guarded it. 'Tooth,' said Orthodocia to the bonze. He nodded and pointed to the shrine. ' Open ! ' said Orthodocia, imperiously. The bonze shook lus head violently, and set the heads of ail the barbarian crowd behind us wagging as if they never would stop. ' Open !' said I engagingly, showing a silver rupee.

'\u003e M ' I ; M We looked up the street and down, but nothing else in the way of a vehicle was to be seen except two or three somewhat less désir-able than the first, thatjnstântly set in ntiad career toWards us while we hesitated. And it was exceeding hot. So we scrambled into it, thinking on the Anglo-Indian luxury we had heard of aforetitne and deeply marvelling. Orthodocia was not of opinion that any respect-able establishment could be induced to take us in out of a trap like tha€; but she gave the driver the addresses we had, and in the devious ways through which that guileful Hindoo took us to fînd them, we had our first look at Calcutta. It was an intensely in- teresting look, and we took it with open eyes and inouths and necks craned far out through the side shutters of the rat- trap we rode in. The great solid British warehouses and railway offices and Govern-ment buildings were tremendously impressive, planted there in the midst of the shifting tide of Aryan humanity that beat through the /vide streets and filled them with wonderful colour and poetry and grâce. They were so enduring, it was so ephemeral ; there was the pang in it that always cornes in the contraSt of conscious strength with ^onscious weakness. And suddenly there shone out among some duU stone walls a brass plate -Jinscribed, ' Office of the Secretary to the Viceroy,' which deepened the curious exultant half-painful conquer- ing feeling, and seemed to throw a flash upon what it must be like to be Viceroy to thèse sinuous brown-skinned multitudes. I think it wak iha\u003c^ass plate that gave riseJ» a contentious spirit between Orthodocia and niyself as to the ethics of a British India. Ortho-docia was verysorry for the brown Bengali, with his pathetic eyes ând délicate featûres. * He has no country,' she said. • We havë . robbed him of his Koliest émotion — patriotism. He cannot know any joy i^. living - witlj our foot upon his neck.' Whereupon I re- sponded disdainfully of the bro^^^n Bengali's holiest émotion, and there came to be strained relations between Orthodocia and me, so that we craned our nccksoutof the opposite sî^B of the ticca-gharri further than ever.

It seetned to us to be by far the most wonderf ul shop we had ever seen, or ever should see. For no matter how gorgeous or how strange the rest of the inarts of the world may be, one never expériences again the charm and marvel of one's first Indian 'eheke,' where, like Sinbad, one might drop a leg of mutton and pick it up again sticking with precious stones. Ram Dass would nothave calledit a 'choke '—that was thecon- teniptuous Anglo-Indian name for it-and would prdbably hâve been offended somewhere in his calm, quiet, sly Hindoo mind if he had heard you do it. We walked in, and he met.us, sala'aming and showing his ghstening white teeth in a smile. The four walls of the httle room were hung with Rungpore chuddars— those soft, light loosely-woven Indian shawls that you can draw through a finger- ring-and gold embroideries and carpets from Mirzapore, ch^ed brass vases from Benares, and marbles from Agra, inlaid with jasper and chalcedony ; and silver dises and slender perfume bottles\" lon-- necked and scorpion-handled, stood on shelves behind glass doors°- and shields embossed and niurderous Ghurka knives 'flashed over the door. Orthodocia asked to see Indian jewellery,' and Ram Dass begged us to honour him by taking the chairs, which he placée beside a white cloth, spread upon the floor.

Orthodocia paid for her purchases in I.O.U.'s.

It Was a spacious mansion, with wide balconies on ail sides of it, and many ser-vants congregated in the ' compound.' « Compound' is Anglo-Indiâp for the enclosure round about. The compound was decorated with branchmg tropical plants set about in pots, which gave uslhe im-pression of private theatricals and made us wonder what the play would be.

It was attai^éd— «t léast one hopes so— to one Kùp Joer Bung, Bahadur Rana, who had confided it to the care of tlie doclor memsahib during his enforced temporary résidence in Calcutta. Kun Jeer Bung was a Prince of a nativef State, which was not a comfortable place for him just then because of his detractors. His detractors wer»^ unkind çnough to say that h^ had killod the old i-uling Prince, hig uncle ; and Kun Jeer Bung was so' sensitive to scandai of thia sort that he had taken up his abode in'Calcutta, where he coiUd not l^ear it. Montréal, in much thfe same way, is popular with niany unsuccessful American financiers.^ This often happons, ai^d^makfss a pleasant exciteinent for Calfjuttb, especially when the detracted'à enemies foUow him secretly «ad poison him, vanishing, and Ictoviiig no traèe ; and it gives the newapapere some- thing to talk about. Kun Jeer Bung, for instance, might hâve been declared a rascal unhung by The Englishman, while The Sjtates- man believed-him a deeply-wronged potentate, suflTering cruel banish- menfc for the crinies of othera. We asked the médical memsahib her opinion, as to whether Kun Jeer Bung had done this thing, but naturally she had none to offer. « You must ask hiin about it,' she said, * he doesn't mind.' Evidently the exile and his establishment were expectipg us ; there was an air of préparation. It was a great bare room intb which we were shown, but the empty Champagne bottles «long the walls were standing neatly in rows ; two or three newspapers were lying folded on the table, and ail the cigar ends and corks ïmd been swept into a corner. The hklf-dozen chairs and one s\u003c^ were grouped round the table sociably. Three of fouryomen, «nd* as many more children, were presently peering out of the long, narrow. apertùres in the upper part of the wall. I don't know what w€ expected the princely aJien to be like, but his appearanoe was de- cidedly surprising. He was a short, fat ysi^g man, with a slight moustache on the upper lip of his handsome, heavy, round face. He walked jauntily, in )rather soiled white ducks, w^U made ia the Eiropeanway; but, of course, he wore no collar.

She promenades the depk on the general's ann ori/y. She is the warlike personilication of the domestic vi^tues. She wears a capacious sealskin coat when the night breeze is chilly, but you feelinstinctively that it does her injustice, that to be properly appreciated her n.assi ve exterior deserves the révélation of dinner dress. She sits down unostentatiously, but where she sits she makes a Place, and everybody on deck is aware that that Place is occupied by the general's wife. It is also noticeable that itjobody drops unconsciously in. the general's wife's steamer-chair, as everybody does into the steamer-chairs of other people. '^ • It is a novelty to the transatlantic féminine mind to encountcr tins lady in the ante-chamber of the bat^i when it is the turn of the transatlantic pe.-son belonging to it to go in first. Probably nine- tenths of the rest of th^ women on the ship would say, ' Afteryou madam ! and receive an icy bow of acknowledgn.ent as th'general's wife sailed m ahead, itowels flying.

And perhaps she was rîght, though the self-denial was difhcult at the tiine. The world of Bombay rolled by below tlia balcony, Vhen the sun «as goneand a coôlness crept infrom the sea-Hiiidooand Mahom- niedan baboos. elbowing unctuous Parsees, palaniju^n-bearers elbow. ing both, water-carriers, peddlers, jugglers, beggjjirs. It was the time of a llindoo festival, and ail the Hindoos of the street, nien, wonien and children, weré strangely splashed, as to their garments, with a bright magenta dye, It was absurdly funny in the children, who looked exactly as if some facetious person had dipped (Hiem into an ink-bottle and carefully wrung tliem out again. Carnages drove by with ladies in them, native ladies brightly attired, unveiled, and barehe-uled, the wives and daughtersof the Parsee merèiant princes, who let their womankind look at the world unafraid. Half a dozen conjurersbosought backsheesh below the balcony, hoad/thrown back, eyes appealing. They would do ail they could for a four-anna bit.' Weheld it up to one of the ragged créatures, and instantly he was seated upon the ground, unfastening the basket that contained his stock-in-trade. Out stole the twisting bodies of two or three yard long snakes, one of which immediately tried to escape across the street° to the intense terror of the ticca-gharri men opposite. The conjurer caught it and hung the three round his neck. One struck at his lean brown hand, and he held it up, bleeding, to increase the back-sheesh. Then he put the snakes back, and brought forth two bags. Fronrone he released a most alarming looking cobra, from theother a mongoose, tied by the neck with a string. The unfortunate little beast, which l^d about the shape of a leraonade bottle and the size of a small kitten, made the most violent efforts to be off, and acted as if it had never had so much as a bowing acquaintance' with a cobra in ail its misérable life. The cobra, rising and undulatin- and s^^aying with majesty that defied the dégradation of its circum'! stances, struck two or three times at the mongoose and finally did attract the wretched creature's attention. By that time, though, tlie conjurer thought he hadshown us a g*enerous four annas' worth, and unceremoniQusly Jmndled his possessions iûto-their.~respective bagsî-- We dropped the coin, and he wpnt off, sucking his finger. We slw conjurers several times in India, but found them disappointing. They '■t",

Once we heard what struck our nerves as a really thrilling incantation, low, weird, suggestive of the most inti- inate connection witli the Evil One. I bent and strained my ear to catch the syllAbles of that request for the assistance of the Prince of Darkncss.

It was the second time we had heard his nàme on the Hps of a dweller there. And we concluded that since the days of the travellers who first told us of thèse tliings, conjuring had become a degraded art. ' Gynikana ' sports were going on in an énclosure opposite the hôtel that first day we spent in Bombay, and we fell in with the multitude to see the ' tent-pegging ' by the officers of a régiment stationed near. With a vision in my mind of two gallant fellows flying past on horseback and picking up a tent on their spears between them as they went, which was the only form of tent-pegging that struck me as being adapted to warfare with native tribes, I asked a kindly old Anglo-Indian near me where the tents were. He smiled politely, and said there were no tents — I would see. And presently I did see, when a splendidly-sitting young officer came thundering by on a gallant Waler, and there was a flash toward the ground, and he rode on, lance erect, with a Hprge wobden peg, the earth still clinging where it had been driven in, on the end of it. Then the next came, and the next, and the next, and some succeeded but most missed, for this is anything but an easy thing to do. And . the sight was exhilarating, for some of the horses were Arabs, and some were ' barbs,' and both they and their riders were very fine animais indeed. ' But I saw that Anglo-Indian go away and speak to three other A.nglo-Indians, and they ail turned their backs and laughed to i-end themselves, and I had an extremely uncomfortable idea th it I knevr what it was about.

Perhaps ï need not tell you how they first arose among the Pçrsian liills three thousand years ago by coramaad of Zoroaster ; how he, believing theçjements to be sacredsyrtibols, decreed that they should never be defiled.

(lis body should be placeuon a toWerhighabove ail humanhabitations, ; hat living men should escape its pollution, and no foot should enter ihere^ but those of its bearers who should leave it and coma away. And the towers of Zoroaster's thought three thousand years ago were the towers with the latest sanitary improvements that stood before us in the month of March and the year of grâce eighteen hundrotl and eighty-nine, which gives one an idea of the real meaning of con- ' servatism. , * There was a toy tower, a little model, in the garden for the amusement of visitors, and, as we . contemplated it in the scientitic spiritf'V model always inspires, the old Parsee. gabbled his oft-told taie of filters and conduits. And even as we looked f rora this to the five real towers with a fasçinatior^ that a horror sometimes has when it is slightly grotesque, ànjfl noted the square sixth one the old man pointed out as set apart for criminals, a commotion seemed to begin in the trees about tht^m.:' Then crie by onç there flapped heavily out ofi the branches, cj^frl^'liideous birds, with fierce hooked claws and featherless hea^ arid necks.

Ihis one, for eight people, was not luxurious, but big and well ven tilated and comfortable, an English and American compron\u003eise, with the door and platform at one end, broad leather-covered seats runnh.- ^engthwise, and a little toilet-room at the other end. The' floor was bare, artd upper berths might be let down from the walls of the carriage if they wer^ wanted. There was no officious black portier to pull them down unnecessarily though.

One thing more : the Windows were fitted with khus-khus tatties, wheels woven of fragrant Indian grass, that re- volved at a push through a tank below with water in it, and came up refreshingly cool and fragrant and dripping for the hot air to blow through at every tum. The khus-khus tattiè is one of the hot weather housekeeping comfOrts of the merasahib also.

Even the far liiountains lacked the blue graciousness of mountains generally, and clave the air in hard aggressive mai^ses, with uo compromise in their tints. Occasionally we passed wheatfields anâ rice-paddies, but the land seemed chiefly bw jungle and alkali plain Now and then we saw, solitary in some tangled space, a tree with thick black misshapen boughs, leafless, but feearing large flamë-red flowers iii tluck profusion, a kind of magnolia. The Hindoos tell one that in the beginning, when ail the trees were made, this one was ovèr-vain —that it was decreed, therefore, never to bear leaves and flowei-s again at the same time. As we saw the tree it had a strange tierce air, as if its flowers consumed it.

We found Agra as • n.itive ' \u003crf India as Tokio had béen of Japmi. l)arkness was settling dowM over the masses of low-walIé«b. houses and narrow street« ; but every squa- lid little open shop, diiefly holding tinselle\u003cl gew-gaws, sent a floo\u003cl whieh was full of «H W^ p,.,j,,, ,„j ^,^^, ^^- the g,udy httle rll^ {* • chariots, high, two-^ wheeled fantasti- f ^ W cally painted, the shape cf an old woman's '^ * ( p,ke Ix^nnet, they caH cKkas.

Tlie driver struck out with liis whip indiscriiiii- nately, and the syce behind used what we imagined to be volublo profanity, wliich scattered and silenced thein for a moment ; but immediately tliey- .closed in again more iniportuiiate than bcforè. Presently \\vo rc.iched the end of the street, where the struggling inass was thickest and the uproar most deafening. Looking out, we saw a star-lit sky and palms waving against it. Under thèse a façade of duskily lighted liouses, latticed and balconied, white and pink and yellow. The excited crowd swayed in front, waving torches, and froni its midst into the semi darkness rose, lofty and grotesque, and in some sort majcstic, the head and neck of a camel riddon by two or threo natives beating drums. The syce came round to the gharri window. ' See ! ' he shouted, 'nautch ! ' He turned the horse sb that we saw at one side, on a sort of platform among the trees, two huge and hideous figures, blood red and grinning, for which we knew no better name than idols. Behind thèse something seemed/'to be going ou. The syce invited us to descend, but we felt several degrees more comfortable in our yliarri in that multitude. So, as we would not go to the nautch, the nautch came to us. Th« crowd parted, and a slender girl came through, with slow steps/aiid passes, the drums ar^d conciles and flageolets playing with r^doubledl^i^n and fury. Sho put her hands on her hips and looked ^'Êa,. .^' ^4^ face was painted, and thére was a charcoal addition to ll[4^r^Ë^y^ies.

We showed her a rùpsfe'and she began to dance for us. The fanious nautch ^ Orthodocia and I watched it begin with ail the qualms and thrills that accompany a deliberate impropriety of behaviour ; for many times \u003eve had heard of its iniquity, and now to witness. it, alone — impromptu ! But the qualms and thrills departed, one by one, leaving our consciences reprieved. For her performance was nothing more extraprdinary than a succession of wrigglings and contortions, of putting one foot before and the other beliind, df crossing her àrths on her breast, or locking her fingërs above her head.

India, Orthodocia remarks under this head, is not a country of old architec-tural monuments. It lias added no Sphinx to the problenis of modem humanity. (I shall enjoy telling you about Orthodocia and- one wehave !) Its peoples, she says, raeàning India, builded for their time as a gênerai thing, and the wave of the next century obliteratcd the traces of the last. So, • Akbar's red bulvvarks, shutting treasiireâ in * With league-long ramp of sandstone,' giither more than their rightful share of intcrest and colour and feeling, as a sUrvival showing exceptional breadth of conception and power of achievement. l'ra not absolutely sure that Orthodocia is right about this ; but l'm much obliged to lier for the paragraph, which reads well. There is a good deal more of it ; but when one is given an inch one doesn't always like to take an ell, and perhaps she will want to print it herself. But Akbar builded and Victoria occupies. As we drove through the wide space in the tremendous walls where the iron gâtes used to be, a red-coated ' Tommy ' lounging on guard at either side stood up very straight and importantly ; and inside in an asphalt quad- rangle we saw the careful white parallelograms of a British tennis- court. The roads inside the Fort were smooth and hard and wide ; the sunlight lying in broad white masses over them and over the tiled roofs and shining dômes that Akbar's Mussuhnan successors had gathered within it. Our driver, with the pertigaeity of his kind, stopped half a dozen tiines at places which hé knejtfîill right-minded tourists wisli^to mspect \\ but we confusedhis notions of the désires of the salàh-lol^ by declining to get out, and entirely upset them by sending him on when we reached the heart«of the Fort — the scène of the extravagant domesticity of Akbar and Jahan and the rest — aiijl stroiling away through the curious old refl place by ourselves.

This is a mark of esteem, Orthodocia found out somewliere, still very popular in native India. For any guest of considération the Rajah willwhitewash ail over~his house, his stables, his temples, any antiquities on the premises he thinks the stranger may be interested in, his record, his grandmother. It is ennobling, but monotonous in gênerai effect. We followedthe hand, and it showed us into a wide empty raised terrace, columned like the other, looking into the garden, with a great black marble slab in it that once upheld Shah Jahan's golden throne and flashed baok the stones that were set therein. Hère he must hâve sat magnificently in his gold-embroidered robes inwrouglit with jewels, and heard petitiojis and dispensed justice, and looked upon slaves, and received tribute, and watched the feâts of his courtier horsemen, and listéned to the laughter of his dark-eyed harem peeping through i\\\\\u0026 grilles in the wall above his head. The hand led ^n and we found ourselves in a maze of xiusty corridors and twisted stairs, with Tiere and there a mysterious windowless cell-like room that suggested what domestic insubordinatif)n must hâve nieant in the establishment of Shah Jahan. We went through one of them gingerly enough, for it had been let to a family extremely resentful of intrusion — a thousand or so of Indian wild bées. If they had decided to put their minds to it they could hâve stung us to death in half an hour, but their attention was entirely occupied with their own affairs. There seeméd to be nobody in the place but an occasional native who followed us furtively in the hope of backsheesh. To such as thèse Orthodocia would turn with an air of majesty and say inipera- tively ' Jow ! ' I hâve not the least idea of the meaning of ' Jbw ! ' I don't much think Orthodocia had either, and I am convinced that the natives had not ; but usually when she had said it' throe tiines they went away. The old pile. was fuU of surprises. We stepped oui once upon an open passage that ran along the top of the wall of the Fort. '^ittle round-pillared balconies jutted out of thisl and we sat down on the floor ofSne of thèse ancTïooked away across below us at one of the most exquisitely-blended scènes one could find in tl\\p \\vx\u003erld.

Not a leaf, not a tree, no trace of the tenderness or gentleness of the human world— yes, one. We saw it as we turned au angle in the sharp, zigzag road up-hill— it lay in a hoUow,' softiy green, the griin, torn rocks threatening it ail round about, a tiny pjace where the people who must always stay in Aden are comforted with grass and flowers. Orthodocia had spent a good \u003cleal of the time between Bombay and Aden in the exclusive socièty of her pen and a big, Hat-bottomed cabin inkstahd - so niuch, indeed, that it began to be runioured on deck that she was writing ^. bpok, and people becanie shy of ex-pressing theniselves before her for fear their statements might be ,.j-eproduced in print witt) nanies attached.

Orthodocia could not convince anybodv but me that she was not a literary character, her note-book bein^ ' ■ circumstantial évidence of the most damàging description ; but I knew that the volumes shé wrote between tiffin and afternoon te.i were intended for the most limited private circulation only, ami were addressed in varions indefinite ways that seemed to offer :i chance of reaching Mr. John Love before he left India.

It was actually not until after dinner, when we had begun to go àbout clad in ulsters and travelling rugs, seeking tho corners nearest to the engines and envying the stokers down below, that a dep'utation was formed to wait upon the aaptain and request simié justification for the conduct of the weath^r, regarding which he seenied to consider himself irresponaible. We succeeded in making him say, however, that he Jiad 'tiever seen it freshor this time of year,' which wassomething. And nobody was warni until we got to Suez and set foot '\\\\\\ Egypt. It seenied to be a pale, water-colour country, full even to this ou ter edge, which had suffered somewhat from foreign usage, as ou ter edges in the East are apt td do, of délicate charm. There was a gray, well-baked wall with a gâte in it, thatthrew blocks of shadow uftpn the dust lying white in the sunlight. In the gâte an old Ai;ib ^sold little Hat oranges, yellow \\ike fiame ; a waterway slipped fiast giving back the tender sky ; iri the near distance the tjvll, tilted masts of some dahabeehs grew out of the siiud. The Arab was . cross-eyed, and behind the gâte were only the Conipany's offices ; but in tlie soft illusion of one's first «juarter of an hour in Egypt comnionplaces hâve no conséquence. One aoes not even object to them. They are not to be accounted. We sauntered through the dusty little town after our luggage to the railway station, where it was a shock to find ourselves enlight- èned in Frencli as to our movements. Up to this pointi in our journey round the world, the alternute language had been !l^glish. Orthodocia thought it extVemely ungrateful of the Khédive after ail ' w^ ' had done for him, but I suppose that is a matter about whicli th(? Kheciive is entitled to an opinion. At the railway station, too, we tnade acquaintance with the little virtuous silver piastre, and the big unprincipled leaden piastre, wh;ch is the first thom in the flesli inligypt — carefully payingallthe little virtuous ones away in back- sheesh, and cherishing the big unprincipled ones to settle hôtel bills with, and other matters of financial magnitude.

And a little, black-eyed Frenchman,' with long haïr and a drooping moustache, and a shabby coat, and a wife and daughter, rather disconsolately débonnaire, shared the car- n«ge-vvhich, injustice to the Khédive, I must admit to hâve been a second-class carriage-with us. The little Gaul carried a larc^e framed crayon poivrait of himself. It was set carefully on the s^t opposite him and evidently represented his profession. In the por-trait though, the long hah- waved glossily, and there was anUffecting ideahty under the pensive eyelids, and the moustache was waxed to correspond, and there was something like a décoration in the trim button-hole, which, however, may hâve been only an artistic detail- without doubt the counterfeit of Monsieur in a former and more prospérons state. He regarded it atfectionately now and then absently twisting the original moustache and running his fin-ers through the original locks, to approximate the idéal opposite. The at easily amused, philosophieal wife glanced at it proudly, and the little precocious theatrical daughter stood before it lost in profound admiration. They did not speak of it-perhaps as a topic it had been exhausted-but they made it an object of interest to Orthodocia and me with a pretended uneonsciousness and naiveté which was delightful. It was an intimate glimpse of France as we seemed often afterwards to find her in Egypt, a little seamy and frayed with the more ornaraental morals a suspicion the worse for wear usually travelling in search of better fortunes, happy in the sun that eases poverty, always bowing, politely, self-respectfully, to the présence of the âges. The family of the artist, he himself and his astral body, got x,ut at Zag-a-Zig, and it was an occupation for a while towonder what scope and what returns a crayon genius niight find in Zag-a-Zig. . j » u» One crosses a bit of désert between Suez and Cairo, with the white, shiftmg, wastingsandpiledsohigh besidethe track thatit be- coraes a marvel how it is kept off t^e rails.

And little clay- built, flat-roofed cities, with a mosquedome rising up, and a tamarisk clump 'drooping over, and pale-brown heaps of roofless walls and hroken pottery that were little clay-built cities once, and stood on other heaps that little clay-built cities hâve crumbled away into since the day's when Nitetis was beautiful and Phanes sailed over f rom Greece. The train stops at a little station bearingon a common wooden signboard ' Tel-el-Kebir/ and inimediately the carriage window fills up with newspaper cablcgrams and medalled heroisni, and Lord .Wolseley ; and one looks eagerly through ail this to find, as one always finds with illogical disappointment, looking for battle sites, only a peaceful sky and pleasant tields, and people going about their businesses as if histôry had ne ver touched thenj. Thére are people at ail the stations, the people of t^jé little clay-built cities, and some are Nubians, and some are Turké, and sonie are Jews, and a few are Arabs, while the Egyptians seem fewest of ail. One judges, of course, from the outer man, knowing neither longue ngr custom.

I came to Orthodocia's assistance. The wife of Achmed continued to h'and up eggs. I pàssed them on to Orthodocia, who laid them in a careful Une along the back of the seat. When we had received fifteen eggs I tried to discourage the wife of Achmed, whose tray was nearly empty. She seemèd to understand, and handed up the last egg, nodding and smiling lo reassure me. Then she ran off to coUoquy with the wife of Yusef, feturning with an air of integrity and one more egg ! Orthodocia said it reminded her of the demi-saison sales in Oxford Street, when one gets so much more than the value of one's money. This suggestion, as applied to the egg», made us very libéral with them to outsiders.

The walls were hung with photographs of yourtg ladies and gentlemen taken in Egyptian dress for the mystification of their fiiends, of a dark-eyed Roumatiian, done wit#great folds across her forehead, and before her ears, a travesty à la Sphinx, of the Kheâive and the son of €he Khédive, of Gênerais, and Pashas, and-Beys.

And there, in the Muséum at Boulak, it holds its graceful form and slender' substance^one can hear the soft wind rustle in it-stiU telling of that sunny ^ morning, outliving grief, outdying death.

He was placarded 'Ramses II.,' but we did not care ilbout hiiri as Ramses II. or ' The Sesostris of the Greoks,' and' the fact that he encouraged culture and the arts and presented a libi-ary to Thebes, had no weight with us. How should it matter what Herodotus said about him ! He held our eyes as the stubborn old Pharaoh of a hundred sermons and Bible stories — distinctly, as I looked at him, I saw the scratched paint on the back of a Prcsbyterian pew in Canada, and my own small boot, and felt the emotiona of a culprit — and we stared, shocked and angry with the défiant old mummy, in spite of Herodotus, thinking of the taie of bricks. It was those lips that said to the oppressed of Israël, ' Ye are idle ! Ye are idle ! ' — tliat arm that pointed, impérial, ' Cet you to your burdens ! ' 'You wicked old man ! ' said Orthodocia. Then, thinking of his slain first-born, when there was a grèat cry in Egypt and not a house where there was not one dead, slie softened. Just then, I remember, came up the Scotch elder and his wife who were going to the Hioly Land.

Baedeker told us who the peOple were, but their commingling was dazzling, and we coul^ not apply Baedeker. To us they were an endless twisting throng in sandals and tarboosh, and floating robes of blue and yellow and white, that movod against the dusky mystery of the shops, and made fascinating bits of colour where the shadows dèep- ened in the distance. Their faces had as much of the pallor of the Eftst as of its deeper tints, and differed, of course, in type, but they a^l wore the dignity that seeias to be the Oriental substitute for a Wiul, and were f uU of that agreeable unconcern which, after our con- science-wrangles of the West, it is worth travelling a few thousand miles to look upon. Only the negroes we could tell — they were so black, and so big, and so supercilious, and so gay of vestraent. To turn a corner of old Cairo and corne upon a large, selfl-satisfied negro, habited as he knows nature intended hini to be, and expanding in the sun he loves, is not a matter to be looked over in noting the 'pleasures of El Kahir. Woraen, too— we regarded them curiously ; and they looked at us often with a smile in their eyes— conscious, tantalising eyes that shine lustrous between their blackened fringes, with a gilt wooden tube between and a yard long strip of yashmak hanging from it, making a mystery of nose and lips and chin. They may ail be beautiful — the presumption is against it, but the possibility is always there, and until crow's-feet gather too palpably above the yashmak, the eyes express die possibility in the most alluring manner— know- ing very well that you are thinking of it, secure in the knowledge that you can't find out.

There were richer merchants, whose possessions filled two rooîns. Of thèse waa Abu-el-Hassan. Abu-el-Hassan, por1;ly and courtly, speaking French, producing, with niuch grâce, a box of Turkish Delight to assist our délibérations qn his inlaid cabinets, his heaped-up em- broideries, his Persian antiquities. As we sat in thé tfempting little back room of Abu-el-Hassan, and wondered how much over*^ charge one was honourably bound to subniit to after partaking of the double confection çjf his politeness and his sweets, he showed us/- his chiefest treasure. It was a soft, rich carpet, deep p»ed andF . velvety, full of flickering colouc%-writh hère and there a sparkle of fgold. Its price wasone hundred and fifty pounds. ^bu-el-Hassan stroked it fondly. ^here came a real, beautiful pleàsure into his face. 'It is my lofe ! ' said he. On account of which^sentiment Orthodocia paid him, I am convinced, a great many unnecessary piastres. i Corning out and away, we stopped beforè handsome young Abdallah, a seller of perfumes, 'of kohl for blackening the eyelashes° and henna for staining thte finger nails, and bouglït tiny heai»t- shaped green bottles of a,ttar of roses. As we bought, a friend of Abdallah's came that way--such a dainty young lady with tripping little feet, and a piquant face, unveiled.

Wo were discussing how we should go to Heliopolis to see the obelisk there, and I was urging the donkey way of going. Up to this time we' had been spending what was left of our substance at an alarming rate upon victorias. , From the first I had regarded the donkeys longingly, feeling instinctively that I should adorn one ; that I, who am no horèewomain, would sit a donkey with composure and grâce. They inspired me withi a confidence and a désire to get on which I had never felt in connection with any other quadruped. But up to this time Ortho-docia had said it was * infra dig.,' and when Orthodocia used Latin I knew that there was nothing for it but to accept the situation. On this particular morning, however, I confronted her with serious Considérations of finance, and donkeys are as cheap in Cairo as çarriages are dear. Just then Rub'icundo passed at full trot, with an hilarious Jmmmar ' behind, an inspiriting sight to see. ' Dear inan ! ' said I, with enthusiasm, ' what a glorious'time he is having !

But aswe hâve often toVd each other since, peoplemust travel round the world With their friends to know them. 'Do, Orthodocia ! ' I supplicated, restating lihe argument of the exchequèr. And Orthodocia did. We found a group of donkey-boys round the corner from the hôtel. Orthodocia said that the amount of our entire expenses in Cairo would not induce her to mount in front of the piazza.

I deeply desired eacli donkey m turn. ILul time permitted I would hâve taken a gay anJ fanciful excursion înto the unknown on the back of every one of them. But ti.ue did not permit, so I selected, for his serions deportment and other excellent featur«s, an ass named Mark Twain Orthodocia vacillated also, but not from love. , She regarded the lot with frowning criticism, and considered the testimonials, spoken and written, with stem incredulity. Her final décision was a meek httlewhite quadruped, ' Eose of Sharon.' «Rose of Sharon' had a 'character' from an English nobleman of distinction-I think it was the Duke of Hamilton-in which a certain prominence waa given to her tractability and sweetness of disposition. Then the elect donkey-boys scuttled ofF to change the trappings for side- saddles. ' Not that it wiïl make much ditterence ! ' remarked Ortho-docia, with something very like a groah. 'Get on tirst, dëar!' said my friend persuasively, when the quartette came back, stroking her white donkey on the neck and nose. « l'il follow you in a minute. I like to-to get them to know me ! At this the white donkey tossed his head and made an ' allemande left,' Orthodocia going patiently af ter it. I may say, in no boastful spirit, that I vaulted lightly into the saddle, and that Mark Twain and I participated in a spirit of perfect good-feJlowship from the beginning. He was my very, very fîi^t donkey, and the émotions he-inspired were of that deliciously pristino diaracter that one loves to look back upon in after Ijfe. No other donk,îy can ever be to me what Mark was-I called him Mark We were on terms that permitted the use of his baptismal name at the end of the tirst half-mile.

Indeed, the biidle-rein was à mockery, and the whip a vain thing ; he recognised no authority except his ma^ter's, who ran behind and discoursed tCM him ; and his rider had no care or responsibility on his account. This is what niado donkey-ridin\" so superior an attraction- to me. € had only to bouiice naturally and be happy. Sonie people, especially equestrians, would not hâve liked it, I know. For instance, when it became apparent that Orthodocia was not catching up,. and I wanted to go back to look for her, I conimunicated my désire to tlië dotikey in the usual way, He did not take the slightest notice of me. I exhorted him, and clung with both hands to one rein. He trotted on with that composure which is the spécial talent of his kind. I was obli-^ed tinally to ask the donkey-boy to turn him round. He said one word — I hâve always bçen sorry not to remeniber the word : in iroin\" through life one meets so many of Mark Twain's connections who are difficult to persuade— an(t the donkey swerved round as if he had been arranged on a pivot. An equestrian doubtless would hâve con- sidered this humiliating. I am not an equestrian, and I thought it satîsfying to a degree. It so thoroughly relieved one from ail complicity in case of accident. I found Orthodocia still stroking the nose of the Rose of Sharon ; and there were sonie fragments of biscuits lying about which shedid not explain. • I iUnk she knows nfe now ! ' my friend remarked uncertainly ; then, diplomatically, • How beautifully you sit, dear ! Do go on ! l'il be with you in one moment.' Thus flatteringly adjured I trotted off again, and gave myself up to the delirium of my.first donkey without restruint until Oithodocia's voice from the rear, full of woe, smote me upon the heart. ' Ha-ow — very fast— you go ! ' quoth she, quothing shrill and bi'eathlessly, Tlicn when I looked upon Orthodocia I could by no means refrain from laughter, of such prodigious sort that Mark Twain, taking itiii some Personal way, broke into a gallop and left the Rose of Sharon further behind than ever.

' Get up ! ' said Orthodocia. ' It's long after three ! ' We were not on the .point of departure, as you may think, by any unnatural train or ship. We were only going to see the Sphinx and the Pyramids, at the hour Orthodocia considered most fitting for the last Impression of our trip which she intended to capitalise the hour of dawn, To see the day break upon the countenance of the Sphinx, however, at Orthodocia's rate of going, though we had only seven miles to ride, it was necessary to start at least two hours earlier. I recognised the situation, therefore, especially when I saw upon the table in the dim and ghastly gaslight the revolver which ^ Orthodocia had borrowed from Rubicundo the night before for our protection in the event of brigands by the way — and with an in-ternai malédiction upon ail impressions of an unseasonable nature, I arose. A quarter of an hour later, we slipped past the sleeping cham- berlains in the upper corridors and down the wide staircases to the outer portais, which the drowsy Luigi guarded alone. He started up when we indicated our désire to be let out, and stared at ub, Orthodocia said afterwards, as if we had been guilty of some un- conventionality.

' ' What a voice ! ' said she. I retorted that I thought Mark hàd à very nice voice indeed for a donkey ; and in the discussion which followed we suddenly began to descend the sandbank, We went with a certain rapidity to Ihe bottom, and by the time we reàchpd it our désire for elevating senti-ments seemed to hâve disappearéd for ever.' Orthodocia declared, as she shook the saiid eut of t'hfef.hfliir, that the Sphinx lookèd like an Irish washerwoman from that point of view, and I considered tlie washerwoman libelled by the oomparison. This did not lead me to consider Orthodocia'sfirst impression less valuable, butitconfirnied my belief in the instability of ail sentiment evolved out of its proper connection with meals. \" Pièces of thè paws of the Sphinx, with rough, primitive mortar attached, were lying about in the sand. If there was a person jointly considered by Orthodocia and inyself a thoroughly disi-eput- able individual with a small niintï, it was the person who carries off 'relies' of famous objects he-éecs in foreign countries. Tins severe opinion not being upon the surface of our mincis, however, we carefully pioked up and cherished lumps of the Sphinx's piws, not, I think, because of tlie Sphinx, but because, of the mortar. It brought us-^M'e fancied we could «see the very finger prints in it — into such close, homelj, intimate relation with the people who laid it on the other side of the centuries ; it seemed to tèll us more than Mariette had at Boulak.

If it had not been for our misadventure, we would doubtless hâve resented the uncomprehending sacrilège of the smiling Arabs wait- ing at the top to ofier us ' coffy wi'thespinx '— thick, hot, black Turk- ish stuff, in tiny cups.

We had expected the Pyramid, some- how, to be pointed, as it is in the pictures. Then , came a sensé of its awfiy rugged vastness, spreading down on four sides of us, block outedging block, into the waste lapping round its thirteen acres. It was a little like standing on a syftimetrical pile of .the centuries. ; 'Remarkable view !' said the cleric of High Church tendencies and the advanced opinions ôf 1889 a.d., tapping with his stick the caTpstone Cheops laid upon Jiis Pagan tomb somewhere about 3,070 B.c.

It was, after ail, not the view but the shadow that. was so notably worth climbing to the top of the Pyramid to look down upon ; and the shadow, strangely enough, as we gazed, grew more signi^cant than the Pyramid.

She said by way of excuse, that she knew it was simply silly and ridiculous, and that she was sure I couldn't understand it ; but that in spite of ail the pleasures of the Orient and my delightful Society, she was getting homesick ! I had observed a diminution in Orthodocia's interest in most things for some little time, so I begged to know since when. And she replied, ' Oh, for the past three or four weeks ! ' which sp;ice, though a little indefinite, dated back quite conclusively enough to Agy^. So I mused upon the nature of impressions, and mournedmly ; but packed my trunk, and said no more. With a motive j|^wer dating from Agra in Orthodocia's mind, probably located close to founts of tears, résistance would hâve been imbécile. But I little thought, when I contemplated our journey round the world, that it-could be wrecked, so to speak, by a little thing like the Wigginton Post- Office. Orthodocia's spirits rose ail the way to Ismailia to such an extent that she was quite willing to gratify me during the two or tfîfèe hours we had to wait for the ship there, by looking at the place from my favourite point of view — the top of a donkey. This fàet registers her state of mind as well as anything could, I fancy. So we had a cup of tea in a vacant little rooîn p£ a vacant little hôtel, with the usual Frenchman's fat wife in charge, and sallied forth. I regret that I cannot set down mtich that is favourable regarding the Ismailia donkey. He does not compare in any one particular with his aris- tocratiç connections of Caire — he is altogether a difi'ecefit quadruped, smaïler, feebler, very ragged, with^t any self- respect whatever.

A ragged, brown-eye^l littlo crowd bronght up the r^u-, and they ail disappeared in the warm sunlight that lay for them as itdid for Claudms over the Appian Way. The loungers on the . jvharf seemed rather disreputably cos.nopolitan-Brindisi is another battered outer edge-but there werc swarthy ones among thein who cned omnges, and two or three insouciant in' -the brave and boasted a tire of Custonis' officers that n,ade Italy enough of the place tobe a pleasant pioture in one's memory. Nobody could tell us of anythin.^ in parfcular to see at Brindisi; but we found for ourselves the pillars that comn.cmorate that march to Rome, and th'e market-place gay with fruits and kerchiefs, and an ancient moat and castle, wherê we sat and let the sun warm us through and through, while Ortho- docia counted the days between that point and the Royal Albert Docks and made a daisy cliain. My friend renewed her extrême youth to such an extent upon this voyage that I hourly expected to \\ see her sucking hcr thumb. This, however, was spared me. She un- blushingly proposed that we should go home by the mail train from Bnndisi. ' Simply to escape the Bay of Biscay, dear ! ' but I found matter for strenuous protest in missing Malta and Gibraltar : and she withdrew the proposition, watching the departure of the people who did get off at BrindiBi. however, with a pathetic resm^tion which. I found aggravating. ■ And by-and-by, sailing southward, we came to Malta, where tho lenvamUr found the most geometrical haven that could be imagined, ail hard stmight Unes and parallelograms and sharp angles.

He tooE us first to the shopsintlieStrada Reale, but'beyond photographs, and silver Maltese crosses, and thick Maltese lace, and serpent te-acelets raade of pink sea-shell, the shops had no particular fascinations. Moreover, it was Sunday, and it is impossible to shop deliberately on Sunday with any degree of enjoyment.\" As Orthodocia said, however, when we clattered oflF among the church-^oers to St. John's, it was a satis-faction to hâve seen what they were like, and it freed our minds for the contemplation of higher things. Service was just about to begin at the famous old church when we reached it. Already it was half-full of peoplewith serions faces. The men were chiefly in ordfnary English clothes, but many pf the women were picturesque in ,J^e Maltese dress of their fpremothers— fuU black silk skirts and plain bodices, with sombre capes gathered halt^way round the edge of a large stiff hood so as to partly conceal the face insidé. As a costume it was rigorous a^d sélect. It. almost talked of sanctity. It was the most unmistakftbly ' Sunday ' dress j either of us had ever seen. . ! I haye no words fôr architectural de^^tion, but the Church of St. John's at Malta is a lovely place, ^, m in. Not only that the vaulted roof glowsin ail the imaginalvé cojour that the art of other timesinvested t\"he Saviour's life wi^^r that the world has brought tribute of allher treasure of poi^hyry and silver and gold for the chapel sanctuaries ; orthat gra^e old pictures gîow with the candle- light that gleams everywhere on pale sculptures and rich fashionings '^^^^\\ a^id precious met«giç, AU this, and more ; but beside, the ,„^'f^W«^° /\"^^ ^ knightlJTmemories, lying under their quaint old \"^ Latin inscriptions on the floor, that it seems almost to hold its service for a solemn congrégation that look over the heads of the frivolous human interlopers of to-day— kneeling unseen, responding unheard. I cannot believe that there is a church anywhere so full of distinct, dignified, important old personalities, ail govemed by the same idea,' ail holding their earthly character and mission in such noble conceit as this Church of the Knights at Malta. Walking over th^m from chapel to chapel, reading the lofty phrase of what they had to say for themselves deep-set in the paving stones, and regarding the nàij 1/",
         "/ N- tl?é superior i first to the ver Maltese ade of pink over, it was iinday with jr, when we was a satis- our minds iurch when irious faces, lany qi the emothers — es gathered •tly conceal It. alinost iday ' dress J Church of ly that the irt of other as brought old for the the candle- fashioninars beside, the quaint old its service le frivolous » unheard. of distinct, same idea, ble conceit hhflTn from liad to say ig the naïj OUR JOUHNEY ROUND THE WORLD 413 sentiments and types of death inwrought there ^fore men leamed to accept the myster^ of it in silence, one feels something very likè envy of the Hfe that ended so. It must hâve been, in the main, simple and self-respecting and unquestioning, never doubting the high nocessity of its création, or the sublimé importance of its mis-sion, and knowing little but that. And that was imaginably more sat;isfactory than our great knowledge and little belief, ôur univer- sal interest spread out thin, our self-pity, our growing wonder why we should be at ail, and whether it is quite worth while. At leasl,* Orthodocia thought so. The skeletons were a most interesting and amusing study in themselves, done as they were in black marble and white and coloured, draped and undraped, uttering allsorts of convictions that go with skeletons. One, which must hâve represented the under- structure of a very frivolous person indeed, wore a bow under its chin. Orthodocia did not consider that an advantageous wa;y, how- ever, of having one's skeleton done. This year, she said, bows were wom under the lef t ear ; next year, perhaps, no bo\\»«s would be worn at ail. She said she thought skeletons ought to be represented quite simply, in unaH'ected positions, a,nd with natural expressions, which would make the whims of fashion in millinery a matter of indiffér-ence to them. She coul^ not quite understand the depth of reality of my interest in them— I, who had never seen such a thing on a tpmbstone in my life— and remarked that shj^sat under one every Sunday in church at Wigginton. I stated that the skeleton was not a popular form of church décoration in America. ' Of course,' re- plied my friend, sweetly, ' you are such a young country, I suppose you haven't got any ! ' Just as we passed Count Beaujolais's efTigy, in purest whi\u003cie mar-ble, the young man lying grapefully, breathing soÇtly, his head on his hand, ' serenissimus et dulcissimus,'a chantarose in the distance, muffled, sonorous, as if the old knights beneath once morecalled the people to armed prayer, and they Ustened quiet in their places but would not go. And then with slow ceremony came the white-haired raisl%4B=fohi?broiëered alb and cope and chasûBIêaiïa^ trailing purple, the crozier going before, a train of priestly youtha with fine pale Greek faces coming after.

She was'very pretty to look at, and so absorbed in them that she didn't mind my looking at her a good deal. They were handed to her by the purser at Pljrmouth ; and though they niust haye been written in the space of a week, under unfavourablè conditions, they would hâve made a volume of ï'espectable dimensions, and, if Orthodocia's face was anything ta go by, of an interesting nature. We were passing Margate or Il;vinsgate, or some such place, when she told me in à rapt manner, which neither your choppy Channél nor^your English east wind had any effect upon, something of ^hat they contained. And I understood that ISfit John Love had determined, after two days and nights of reckless despair, tp go round the world the othef way a» rapidly as possible to Wigginton, where he would arrive; Orthodocia calculated, in about three weeks, and where he was ex- pected — with an emphasis that made me understand in what capacity. She also stated that when he did arrive he felt con^dent that hc would be able to persuade her to telegraph properJy ; but that may hâve been a slight exciteraent) in Orthodocia's mind. And if he did, and she would, they were té live in Vancouver, where Jack had some new interests, which would be ever sa much nicer than Assi- niboia, would^i't it t And Jack, though he entirely disapproved of her spéculation there, had managed to buy the very lot that once was hers to build their house upon, and could anything be more idyllic ! And much more which my regard for Orthodocia, and charity for her state of mind atthe time, induces me to suppress. You may be interested, however, to know the leading points. A few hours later a motherly lady, driving Orthodocia .and me' in a pony-carriage through St. Eve's-in-tïie-Garden, where the \u003c ^ponîoa was beginning to redden the walls ofthe cottages and gpring had corne to atay in the hedgas, reproached me for my",
