         "THE, 194WAR --ILLUSTRA Britain's War, Director The prompt appoint- wpent of Kitchener of SKhartoum Wo. the imhpor- tant post of Minister of rWar bas been received with the utmost satis- laction throughout the JC~mpire. Thc tail Irishl youtii of twenty, who received hs baptism of Brc with the disaster- ridden Frenchi army ini thc Franco-Prussian war, ~bas become the man wiiom thc arrogant Pruasian fears moat of aIl bis enemies. Hs -whole career bas been a course of preparation. Emerging from Wool- wich as a second lieu-- tenant in O.e Royal Engineers-the calculat- Ing, scientifle arm of Steservice-H e r b e r te Horatio Kitchener was - called from survey work in Palestine, to be one of the original 25 Engliali officers who reorganized the; Egyptian army. He .- accompan ied 'Wolseley's beated expediliion to relieve Gordon at Khar- toum; and lie witnessed the evacuation of the Soudan. And then for thirteen years Kitchener reniained in Egypt, plan- niýng, preparing, organ- izing for one great purpose: the rèeovery of the Soudan, and the vindication of Brit6h authority and influence. It was Kitchener'ir methods which vindicated British arms in South Africa. Long, silent, ex- haustive preparation fol- lowed by the swift, inevitýble, crushing stroke. No one but Kitchener could have had tIc eupatience and skili to \"round Up\" the elusive Boer cOmmanders. Then for seven years this great noiseless organiz- ing genius was focussed upon the army of Eng- land's greatest çlepend- ency.

Hungary, the plain facte speak for themeelves. The whole aim sd object of the militaist regime which for a half century past has absolutely controlled Germany bas been avow- ,edly to make the German people subservient at home and feared abroad.

It ie divorced from n ail moral cons;ideratýion--!-from mércy, from u justice, from pity. TJntil this eystem is broken Je and crushed, there can be no peace i this world. How did this eyetemn precipitate the preeent \u003e8 war? 1$ resorted to a devioue course of pro- y cedure. On July 23,- Austria presented to îè ervis an ultimatum making demands the d cc~\u003eaneof which would have been for [y. Servis. national suicide. The assassination of lé the Arohduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the It lmperial crown of Auetria-Hungary was the e pretext which was seized upon for the purpose cf of crushing Servis. The ultimatum. gave Servis oniy forty-eight houre in which to eub- il mit. Servia made an humble reply, agreeig [d to nRearly all demandesud offering to submit le the others to the Hague Tribunal. This offer le Austria-Hungary insultingly rejected.- Noth- ,r ing can be'plainer than that Germany dictated ic that ultimatum, and coerceç Auetria-Hungary d throughout that whole course of events. 1, Let us cite in1partial witnesses. Admirai )f Mahan, retired, of the United States Navy ýn recognized as a foremoet authority on ef5a jd 1ower and n\u0026aa strategy and on hietorical y questions, has written: a '\"The aggessive insolence of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Servia, taken with the concession by the latter of ail the demande except those which were toe L- humiliating for their national self-respect, indicate that )f the real cause of the war is other than that set forth by \u003e the ultimatum. Knowing from psst experience how the matter muet be viewed in Ruesia, it le incredible that Austria would have ventured on the ultimatum - unles he was. assured beforehand of the consent of Germany to it. The inferenoe je irresistible that the substance of the ultimatum wae the pretext for a war [t already determined on as soon as a plausible occasion d Let us cite another impartial' witness, the ýt New York World, which, in dealing with the i5 campaign headed by Count Bernstorff, the a German Ambassador at Washington, to en- 5deavor to change the verdict of Public opinion in the United'States, a campaigu which lias *failed to eecure a reversai of the United States e verdict againet Germany, says: f \"The arguments employed do not appeal to the e American mind. With every desire to bce fair to ail *sides, the overwhelming majority of editorial writers are able to see in the war only a cataclyem provoked e b y German militarism, with the object of making G ermany the predominant Power in Europe. When r Professor Munsterburg and others denounce Britain as 'a traitor to the Teuton race,' because she ides with - Russia, America, Americane recaîl that until the fart T that until recent years Germany'e great ambition was a Russo-German alliance against France and England.\" - It is well kn own that what Bismarck aixned s at was a \"Kaiserbund,\" and alliance of the s three Kaisers-German, Austrian and Russian *i-against the rest of Europe, with the idea of * later on making Austria-Hungary part of the German Empire. But the European develop- 3 mente took another course. The alliances - formed between France and Russia, and Great b Britain and France created:a situation which r made it inevitable that the course taken last July by Germany in, naking Austria-Hungary its tool in thqf matter of the ultimatum to 0 Servia would Provide a pretext for Germany 1 to strike. Germany deliberately took meas- ures to provide this pretext., Sir Edward Grey strained every effort to preéserve the peace of Euoe He macle proposai' after proposai, 0or ferer rFrne, Russia and Italy con- curring, but Germany i every case refusing. Germany was dete inmed on war. In the worde of Imperial Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg: \"If a nation will not, or cannot spend so much onu ite armaments that it-ca' force ite way through the world, it must fait back into the secorqd row. The weak become the prey of the, etrong. Parchment je parch.. ment, steel ijeeteel.\" These words 'I'ere uttered morethan a year- gé-.They mae*weU be cited here by way of preface to the mention of the \"scrap of paper\" declaration by the same Imperial Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg, who je the German Emperor'e chief Minister of State, not responsible to the Ger- man people, for the German people have not reeponeible Government, but responsible only to the Emperor. That speech will etand forever in history as the moet striking utterance of the epirit of the whole canceroue eyetem of systeniatic double-, dealing and cynical - faithiesen ese which had grown up iynder the military autocracy 'at Berlin. In his last interview with the. British Ambassador at Berlin, Sir Goechen, on August 4, the Imperial Chancellor, when he made his \"infamous propoeal\" that Great ]3ritain should allow the violation of the neutrality of Belgiuni, said that the treaty, eigned by Germany as welI as by Great Britain, guaran'teeing Belgian neutrality, was \"Just a ecrap of paper.\" The New York World on August 29, after recalling the fact that Magna Charta, the Bül of Riglits, the Declaration of Independence and the decisione of the Supreme Court of the United States are \"j ust scrape of paper,\" said: \"The Hay-Pauncefote Treaty is 'a scrap of paper,' and one of the most brilliant moral victories won by President Wilson is the Act of Congrees which vol- untarily repealed the violation of the terme of that 'scrap of paper.' Respect for -these 'ecrape of paper' measure a nation's honor no less than ite freedom. Our democracy itself is only 'a scrap of paper,' but it looses forces no autocrat can etay. T he Germani army je the most wonderful military machine ever contructed by the hand and brain of man, but in the final reckoning of history this 'scrap of palier' will prove more powerful than ail the Kaiser's legioneM.\" SThe utterances of the press of. the UÜnited States are noteworthy because the 'JFnited States is not involved in this war,: aud bç*)ue the people 'of the United States are an i4teili- gent and rèading people. To quote one more utterance of one of the journals of highest standing i the United States, out of the multitudes of similar utterances that might be quoted, the New Yorkç Outlook sys: \"Hietory will hold the German Emperor respopeble frthis war.' Austria would neyer have made lrin- defensible attack on Servia if she had not been aaeured beforehand of the support of Germany. The German Emperor'e consent to co-operate with Great flritain in mediation would have put a stop to Austria's advance. To doubt that Germany and Austria have been in alliance in this act of brigandage is to ehut one's eyes to all the signe.\" With the ýviolation of the neutrality of Belgium by Germany the war began. Great Britain, having exhausted every possible effort to avent the war, was finally compelled by its most sacred obligations, as well as by the necessity of protecting both itself and the Empire, to take action, which it did with the instant and unanimous approval sud support of the whole Empire,. It is the British Empir that Germany lias been planning aîl along to destrpy. \"The old century saw a Gerinan Europe,\" said the Emperor. \"The newone shal ee a German world. The trident of power over the sea muet be in our haýnds.\" Said Mr. Asquith in hie speech at the Guildhall on September 4: \u003c'The ultimate and hot far distant aim of- GernialY. was to crush the independence and the autonomy of the free States of Europe. First Belgium, then Hollaiid and Switzerland-countries, like our own, imbued and sustained with the spirit of liberty-we were, one after the uther, to be bent to the yoke, and these 'ambitions were fed and fostered by a body of',new doctrines and new philosophy prèached - by.

Spite of ail that I can do, Tho' I try to cheer my comrades and be gay. Chorus: Tramnp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching, Chéer up, comrades, they wiIl corne; And beneath our country's flag WTO shalLbreathe the air again, 0f the free land in our own beloved home. 2 In the battie front we stood, When their fiercest charge they made; And they swept us off, a hundred men or more But before we reach'd their Uines They were beaten back disrnay'd, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.

         "The preparation of boys for life will begin ini the home. Parents who are wise and loyal wilI think of service in the home, in ,Society, and in the state as well as in the e%,ocation. The time lias gone by for men to think of themnselves and their families alone. The conception of brotherhood muist be broaden-ed to iielude ail mankind, and particularly ail of one's own nationalitv. A writer in a.magazine published in a neutrai country Points out that -even if the motive behindi German unity is tunworthy, even if it is brotight about through misrepresenta- tion and, in a measure, by coercion, the unity is still there. Eacli man lives not onlv for hiniseif but for his state. Possibly the writei- xxas here thinking of the common p)eople, for no one wiIl accuse the ibureau- cracy of Ge rmany of being other than SnIPremIeiy- selfish.

Yet, the idea of a -whole people interested in eachi other and W\"ýrking for a C\u003c'lmion a(l\\-itýa.ye, lias its iessons 0o 11lý. -1here is no doubt«but that in the enaý it is a uinited people x'ho wiii attain to true ge1-aties35. So in the home this idea -f the -rcater brptherhood shotild be emiplizied. i;iîvdévotion is fold, even partx- iovaity o. onruendable, but ighIer and mo re lcr- tlian either is that patriotIsm wliich Q 1je~every mari to consider flo)t lii own tibttthose of his neighL 1ur. t iS easy The ltefoeiaIum T~ HAT which was predicted lias taken J.place. Manitoba, has decided by a two-to-one voteof hier maie popula-. tion to close ail her saloons. Thes; will remain closed for ail time. What this will inean in increased happiness and wealth and in improved moral conditions no one can estimate. Recently a member of the cabinet in Saskatchewan said that'the closing of galoons in that province meant a gain of $15,000,000 a year. Think what the saving in Canada will be when the whole country goes dry. And the saving of money is the least thinig about it. Men and womnen are freed from the awful dread that their chul- dren will grow up exposed to the powerful temptation of drink. Vice and crime wil be les seneçI by seventy-five per cent. Hap- piness wiil visit many ,,iomes that have neyer known anything but misery and desolation. The taking of' a vote does not -end this matter. Administration is everything. The people of Manito'ba have confidence that there will be no failure in this respect. The mandate wlas 50 pronounced that it is com- paratively easy. for a sympathetic govern- ment to insist upon absolute fulfiliment of ail the conditions of the Act. 0f ail the happenings of the past year nothine was of greater importance than the decision of the Manitoba electors on the l3th of March. Well may they afford to smile. Weii may they praise the referendum as a principie of good government. týTJae Traintug et YeuUa. I Tis more necessary than ever for our country to consider seriously the training of its Young people, and more particular- ly the boys. Thousands of Young men have taken up armns and, judging by happenings Up to this date, many will nmt return. More thian thiat, it is the younig men of courage and spirit :and of strong loyalty who have gone, while the loyialty of some of those who remain behind cannot be depended upon. It is n'ecessary that an earnest effort be put forth to develop in growing boys a feeling of responsibility and power to carry on the work ustialiy entrusted to men.

One of our great corporatiozùs re- quired a great number of steel shovels of a certain type. They wrote to one of the largest mantifacturing concerns in England asking for prices and terms., The- answer came back to the effect that the firm had been makin g shovels for forty years, and 'if the kind o f shovel it was producing was notgood enough, the order could be placed elsexvhere. The corporation 'then wrote to a German firm which immediately altered thec form of its shovels to suit the demand. The storx' of the rapid commercial develop- ment of Gcrmàtny may be partly explained by stich an incident. It is for us to profit l)y the illustration. In. the world, of the future, provineialism in thouight and action \\vili i)c suici(lal. Our reading, our schoois, andl ail otiier fornus of culture must uinite to give us the braeroitlook. This does not niean that every Iocalitv may not have its, own individnlalitv and charm. It is hopcd that these will n-eyer lie lost. two are worthy of special consideration. First, there are the forces inherent in the, life of the community and expressed in its institutions. The characterýdf parliamnents, courts, counièils,,tràdes union-\u0026. church life, is reflected in the behaviour of'both old and yoiing. \"The forces operating through the social milieu are prdbably greater than those proceeding from any other source.\" The best thing a man oan do 'to help his family and his own affairs., is to enter wholeheart- edly into the social and political life of the conimunity. If these are wrong, ail wiil be wrong. In the second place, there are things which a community can do by organized effort 'to supplement school and home education. The community is wise that includes public play- grounds and recreation centres, public libraries, and other public necessities, as a part of its programme. The whole commun- ity rather than the individuai home is \u003ethe real unit for purposes of educatiori. The greatest need to-day is the cultivation of a community spirit. Even if for no other reason than seif-defence it is necessary for a mnan to consider the children of bis nei\u0026h- bors. Community provision for\\ mfmunity needs is just as pressing as family-,rovision for faiy n'eeds. This should be regardedi as axiomatic until it is generaily so re- garded, or community life cannot be con- sidered as ideal. The W.rdi VIeW yT is' said with some degree of truth thât J.Canadians are quick to adapt themselves to new conditions. Pioneer life makes m'any demands upon both men and women,. There is one sentse, however, in which pion- eers are the siowest of ail in the matter of adaptation. - On the social side they are necssailycompelled to think in ternis of the looaIity. They are the last to feel the pulse of new movements in civilîzation. They carry on churches, schools, homes, and other social'organirations, as if the custoins of a past genemation were to be customns for ail time. Nothing is more certain thian that the war-- wili make necessary for ail people in ail lands a new order of life-economnic as wel as social Men and women can no longer be local, provincial or even national in their outiook and their sympathies.

On mighty pifions the great fishing bird fioated. It was an old bird with a very white iead, ail its well oiled plumage glittered in the sun, its breast was as whiite \u0026snow. No wonder it fished there, right within our line of vision, low down, near the shore lime, for, on a tal emlock, we spied the female sitting in a great tub of a brushwood nest. As early as this late i' rch day she was setting or laying, an d tTimunseasonable faîl of snow must have kcept ber on, ber nest.

To Ada Ward, the west meant nothing ibeyond a vague idea of roling prairies, wheat, horses and \"getting ricli quick\"' talk, but to, offset ber merciful ignorance of ail before her, she bail a good stock of common sense and .daptability, and an ail-round knowledge of household and fanm management. Bot'h young people possessed healt'h, and with that es'sential qualification, they had a little nioney ta etart out on. After the wrench of parting front the old home, the journey to 'Edmonton was full of interest, ai.d it was not until leaving the train that Ada realized the only'connecting link with the life she knew was varnihing, with the trail aniole.. A few days rest, and on the pioneers etarted by train ta 4'thabasca Landitie, for the autumu was rapidly overtaking them, and Peace River Cross- ing stili te be reached by auy and every menus they could command.

Crowded on the steamer once more, they huddled about the boiler for com- fort, until Sawbridge was reached at the lower end of Lesser Slave Lake. Across its broad waters the boat ploughed al the next day, and it seemed exhilarating after the intricacies and uncertainties of river navigation. Grouard, at the opposite end'6fî the Lake, ended t-heir voyage, and from here to Peace River there was ne one to look to but themeelves, to help theni on their way. AIthough Grouard boasted of be- ing a \"town,\" with shops and, etreets, ta the Wards their own tenit again seeni- ed a much preferable shelter. After two d'ays bargaining, a pair of 'horses and a buckboard were bought. Wàth tent, blankets, groceries pots and pans, tin stove, gun and small trunk packed on behiind the buckboard, they Ïtarted away from rouard,--no one knew them, ne on1e cared, and a mile ont they might have been Adam and Eve, so alone were they, but for thie companionship of the big dog bounding along beside thein.

A fine collie dog shared their fortunes, but roligh as the conditions might ho to his owners, to him anything was boýtter than flying express trains.

In the towns, howeve, the snow and biting winds are dreae, for, after ahl, comfort tends ta create \"saftness,\" and a drap ini temperature that leaves the farmer unmoved bas a painful effect upon the townsmafl. SQn the great plains, f ar away from tbe cities, the changes of the semsons stir a contemplative mind unaccountably. They are so great, s0 immun~e, that man's Baird's prairie dcer-micc mightiest efforts ,;eem paltry in1 com- parison. Humboldt, 1 believe, once wrote to the effect that the marvels of Nature had a tendenicy to sadden, but surely only a morbid disposition would be affected in this way. For most of us, perhaps, \"awed\" would be a better way to express aur feelings, for who has not experienced a feeling of awe or reverence for the master hand behind some won- derful creatîon-whether of man or Nature? The conntryman is generally drawn to Nature, although often unconsciously and studies the movement of the wild life-the animnais, the birds, the plants- with the interest the city person bestows upon bis daily paper, and who shail say the resuit is flot as beneficial-mentally? November is the first winter month. The ground becomes too stiff to plow and the air is pleasantly crisp. Snow is general, and the merry ringing of the sleigh-beUls relieves the silence of the plains. Frequently the first snows are melted and disappear during a mild Epell,making the animais that have changed their coats conspicuous. During a drive after one of these warm spells, scores of jack-rabbits can be seen, and bush-rabbits found in every patch of scrub.

A new one appears fromi time ta time. They are genuine, true, and f ull of human ilterest. able because tbey are smafter and live in hales, although they seem to iead rather a wandering life during the cold months. CThis month the hast of' the migrants- the ever busy wood-pecker--lies, from bluff ta bluff on bis way ta a more con- genial dlimate. The jaurney of the wood-pecker is typical of nearly ail migration. The immense journeys of the birds are, not direct fights from cold ta, warmath, as the older observers believed, but a series of gradual fliglits from one feeding ground to another. south in the fal and'inorth in the spring, along regular routes t4iat have possibly been foilowed ever siice the world has been ini its present condition. Our fore-fathers marveiled at the long distances covered, but in reality this is simple, altbough we have yet to, explain the underhying guiding instinct and many other pr'oblems. December is really cold, but it is far from. being a \"dead\" manth. 1 have seen; bath in Manitoba' and Saskatche- wan, one of the smallest mammnals known, the _pigmy shrew, running an the snaw- erast ini December, when the theçnometer wùs many degrees below zera,',end my cheeks and nase were' frozen, and mY hands nurnbed and useless. Other smal creatures are about also, and the tracks of voles an\u0026f field mice are plentiful- a fact of wbich the great, snowy owls seern ta be aware. The shrews, voles and mice, the prairie bares or jack-rabbits, the bush-rabbits, the weasels and the wolves are the prici- pal animàls ta be seen this mont, 'but there is other life about of an unexpecte kind, for sometimes badger tracks can be seen in the snaw-proaf positive that aur knowledge of hibernation is limited. With the coming of January one feels that the back of the winter is braken, although the weather is generaily colder. The wolves draw nearer the bouses and ýcan be beard bowling in every direction,' ~articularly if any dead horses or cattle ave been dawn out ta the sloughs. The borned larks and snaw-birds are bolder and feed araund the f arm buildings crouching low ta pratect their legs and feet with their body feathers. Thxe sharp-tailed grouse leave the, stubble and straw piles and also candescend ta visit the farm-yards, quarrelling and running about with erected crests in a peculiarly restless manner. There is something very likable about these birds. Tbey are sa independent, scorn- ing, one feels, ta descend ta subterfuge by changing their plumage in order ta harmonise with tbe surroundings. They make no attempt ta conceal tbemselves, often settling right upan the roofs of the bouses. In February tbe cold is still generally severe. An interesting fetiture this mont is the action of the wind upon the snow. In cold weatber the snaw falis in single crystals, and when, towards the end of the winter, a slight crust bas been formed by the increasing warmith of the sun's rays, the wind carves out fantastie and beautiful designs. Wben pressed upan, too, snow, will \" pack, \" and the tracks of the sleighs, human footprints and the trail3 of animais stand out in relief. On fine nights tbe wanderful Northern lights appear.

Ma.rch \"many weather,\" thç oid sit.juùs, but one is tempted to regard ita-the'first month of Spring. Bare ispots dppear on the prairie, and here and there littie pools of water. The goÉhers awaken from their i~ong sleejy, the first birds-the crow-return, stray blades of new grass appear, and there is an indescribable feeling of elation in the air. To the observant, particularly on the mriie, there are no \"dead\" months, f every month, every day, indeed, has an interest of its' own. This article ie brief, for I have omitted many things- the wonderful snow-shoes of the bush- rabbits, the elongated scales along the Sharp-tailed grouse sunning itself on the snow toes of the grouse, the excavations of the badgers in the snow-drifts, the occasional visits of the red-polls-but it may show that winter on the immense prairie need not be duli, and that a person living away at'the \"back of beyond\" is not necessarily out of reach of al'- uplifting influences, and that the cold months need flot really be dreaded. \\ý- The Redskln's War Bonnet and What it Means The typical Indian is always shown4 with a war bonnet, or war cap, of eagle feathers. Everyone la familiar with the look cf this thead-dress, but I find that few know its ineaning, or why the Indian giories in it 50. In the days whcn the red mnan -was uncbanged by white men's ways, every feather in the brave's hcad-dress was awarded to him by the Grand Concil for some great deed, usually in warfare. llence the 'expression, \"a feather iii his cap.\" These decds are nowv callcd coups (pronounced coo), and when of excep- tional valour they were grand coups, and the eagle's feather lad a tuf t of horsehair, or down, fastened on- its top. Not only was each feather bestowed for some exploit, but there were also ways of marking the feathers so as to show the kind of deed. Old piainsmen give an exciting picture of Indian life after téhe retuirn of a suc- cessful war party. Ail assemble in the Grand Council lodge of the village.

By October lat they have beautiful, glossy, snow-white coats and begin their \"lay- ing songs.\" I then begin to \"fced for eggs, and I have every single hien iaying and have dozens of eggs to -seil whien they are séarce and the price biggest. The food must bie ample and variedi. Keep, in mifid \"the four G's\"-grains, greens, grits and grubs. Also clean water should be provided always. Their morniîîg feed is chops, a q. - to twelve h lens, fed in litter. At noon at mash, composed of equal parts of whcat bran, shorts, corn mca! anti about haif the quantity of cotton seed meal, is fed. In this put a little sait and powvdere1 charcoal and mix with skim-milk to 'a crumbly' mixture, neyer sloppy. At night I feed a. good feed of shelled corn, altern- ating with oats which have been soaked for 12 hours. Before them at ail times is kept a bowi of clabber, abox of oyster shelîs, crushed charcoal and pounded-up bits of broken china and crockery. I scald ail water and milk vessels several times a week; and during the ,winter xnonths feed fresh beef scraps ground in my food chopper, or green bone eut fine in a small bone cutter about twice a week. Thtis furnishes pro- tein, in place of insects, worms, etc. A large patch of green oats pianted in September furnishes green food. My chickens do not have colds or roup because 1 put a amail lump of copperas in each gallon of drinking water. They do not have choiera or bowel troubles because their food and quarters are dlean. At 'the first sign of sor.ehead 1 paint the spot with iodine twice, which always stops the trouble. Scaly leg 1 eau kili by one application of coal oil. I provide a good dust pile of dust and ashes mixed, always a popular resort for the chiekens. I set mny hens'as early as I eau after Christmas. The most vigorous chiclks are hatched in January and Fiebruary and are my earliest layers in thlecfal!. llowever, the hast two years, pullets liatchied',,n April and May were pushed to maturity rapidiy and were laying in five montits. gV4 I feed baby chicks on good eg r bread, dry bran, and crushed charcoal for three weeks, thea feed commercial citick feed and chops. Each little brood bias a separate coo-p, whi cl ean daiiv and disinfect weekzl. I get 12 to 14 out qf every 15 eggs set, and hardly ever lueA a chick. Every fal 1 eull my fiock, eating andi seiling cockerels as rapidly as they reacit the proper size. Every lien that is not \"cpaying lier board\" or up to tbe stand- ard in shape or size, or is over two ycars nId, goes to market. 1 seli eggs the year through; seli many sittîngrs in the spring at faney priccs wbhen mnarket eg-gs are low in prive. Sornetimes 1 seli a flock of baby cbic1ks, a good cockcrel for breeding, hiens for roasting, or a flock of pullets to somvoine wanting a start. I liave sr-nt a crate of puilets as far away as Spanish Hondultras andi 1 ain not a proiessional eitlipir, bt an ex-m':s,.ic teaclîir living in a sinall town, with oiuly,,a large bail yard, and who, uintil tw'o years ago, neyer handled a chiciken. 1 have neyer advertiscd in any potiltry journal, and have spent very little for ny cîtiekens outside of feed. 1 got t1iw riinl ock in a trade.

Ughtening trace, thus makinig for an eternal bending of bis strength to the inw of the trace. But onae thing that Mike - oui of a suporior wisdom - did learn was to tbro'w bimsolf out of bis harness. Using one trace oh each dog, t he Eskimo fastens the other end to a nain toggle on the sleigh. Froin this the team when in motion spread out fan-wise, each one exerting his strength individus lly. upon bis own trace. 0f these, tFe leader's is, of course, the longest, allowing him to run ahead. This systein is opposed to that in- use in the Mackenzie Rliver and other sub-Arctic districts of Nortbern Canada, where the double trace systenm is in vogue, the dogs moving in single file. Both ways have their recominenda- fions , but ini the single trnce systein of the Eskimo there is less snarling of harness when the dogs get to fighting among themselves or wif h other teams, and the unsnarling afterwards is coin- paratively easy. Mike learned to get out of bis harness i a peculiar way. Running at full speed, hoe *ould suddenly diverge to one siee, turaing blimseif clear around as hie did so. The resf of the team, sweeping an, naturally carried the end of bis trace forward. When if tightened, the whole harness was carried over bis back and ail the pressure of the onmovinig team eiterted to draw it forward against the collar, which enabled Mike, by sorre peculiar twist of bis neck, ail bis ou n to slip free. He bad learned this trick long beforo hoe came. ta Fort Churchill tci serve fe mnounted police, and thougli the moen tightened Lis collar almost to choking, Mike always managed to accomplish hià freedom whnhle so desired. He did if only on rare occasions when seized by some strangely corne whim, and not off on enough to count 'aglainsf bis value as a leader. So the men came fo ailow him these littie spacos of freé.- dom, for though bis pulling value was for the time being lost, he still kept ahea4 of the téam, turning fa right. or leff at the driver's commiand, thus successfully performing Fis duties as a leader. Inspector llodney, oficer commanding Fort Churchill mounted police post, sat in bis office loohing ouf over the frqzen expanse of desolation thaf stretchee-' away froin the shore of the Bay to the tree lino beyond. If was a fair day and win0less, and the Inspector, nofing thîs, (lecided on a couple of days' hunting. Foilowing the thouý:ht, ho arase, went in search of Doctor Mortimer, the police surgeon. In an hour the sled was loaded. As the Doctor and the Inspector wcre about f0 depart, Sergeant Nîclin, tCe recond in. command, accompanied Ly the rcst of the nmen, came in w-ith the second dog tcam drawing a load of wood.

Again the advance guard of the blizzard came snooping down the aisle of dying day, a long moaning note that 'hurled ittie flurries of snow from Ôverbumdcned branches and set the stunted pine to whispering.

With startling suddenness the wind increased frorn a ten-mile breeze to a twenty - mile blow, then thirtv, then forty and faster and faster tili it drove along f ull a mile a minute gale.

Meanwhile, after stumbling a few hundred yards, the doctor, blinded by the pitiless beat of the snow, had dropped to bis knecs. A long tme he remained thus, whilc the cold crept up and up in hie veins through which the blood pulsed ever sloweru from suspcnded action. A listlessnes crept over the man; hie every limb and muscle secmed oppresed with a vast heavinees. A duli lnguor followed. Hie whole being cried to rest.

After fort eare of aîe the tendency Ws to exerose less and the resulting \"weakness\" or décline ini muscular forceý is laid to thé charge of middle age, whcni in reality men, and women tob, should bie at theï, best, physically and, men- tally, in middle life. Apart fromn setting aside a definite part of each day for physical culture, it is most important, also, -to avoid the~ defects, the bad habits, the muscular sins that middlé-aged people habitually commit. The man who stands badly as a regular thing, the woman who sits in a defective attitude whea sewing or reading, wili. not correct the evils of such habits by any physical culture in the form of exercises. ]3efore decidiag upon phiysical culture at ail, the importance of correcting bad habits already formed mnust bie realized. Criticize severely how you stand, hov vou. sit, and how you walk along the street. Ask someone to point out aIl your defects of position aad action, or at least as many of tbem as you can receive with polite equanimity. Not one person in a hundred stands straighit, or knows how to sit in a chair, so as to get aIl thé support and the rest that it is possible to obtain. With regard to cor- rect versus incorrect walking, we have only tf observe the passing throng to realize) te inlierent lack of grace in our felloUcreatures. The dash and energy of youth cover a multitude of sins, but ia middle life muscular defecte are sadly apparept if one cares to look for them. Too m4ny men are -the victims of an un- becoming adiposity in mniddle life; top many- matrons degenerate ixito the floppiness, the dowdiaess characteristic of the aftermath of youth. 'ihere is somethinig inexplicably satig- factory about a middle-aged mnan or woman who bas the energy, the physical alertness of youth combined with thé ,poise and dfignity of maturity. Thé habituai physical attitude indicates very strongly the mental ouitlook, the châracter of the person. And the con- verse is als981-triie. If tve take the trouble to acqui're physical well-being, to cultivate our muscular system as we should, it will reaet upon our mental power, our character. Try the effect of a few weeks' re-Ular physical culture' if proof of the assertion is desired. Practise tlie art of correct standing, with' the shoulders braced, yet so thiat the Uine of the body is so straiglit that thiere is no bulgiag forwards below the waist. Stand ini profile before a mirror so that you can observe anv defeet of position, and watch carefully and con- L!nuously until the habit *of correct, easy, graceful standing is acqil;red. Mdany people appear old before théir ime, simply because they allow the hack to droop, and a round back has a peciîliarly arueinoe effect. Correct stand- ng- has an enormous influence upon bealth and good spirits. Anvone who habitually stoops Js not allowingy sui- cient room. for the lungs and ieart to act casily, the circulation is consequently inpeded, and thé vitali.ty of the éntire sYstem is affected for the worse. Correct stati4ingr in the ereet position, on the other hand, increases the capacity of the chlest, and thée pace available for lie abdomninal organs, the liver, stomach, and intestines. HabituaI stooping, a defective position in standing or walking, ricaîs that uiitiatur-al pressure is exertcd n aIl the organs, causîng tlîem to ««sag\" nd to drop forwarils perhiaps an inch or two belowv the normal.

Miss Matty, you 'ivil recoilect just cauldn't bear ta stoop down ana1 perundcrneath, sa she used ta rail a bail under. If the bail came out at the other side--wel nd good. But if not- she had ber hand rcady ta the beil-rope ta summon aid.' . But nowadays of course, beil-ropes werc out of datcLand it was not always possible ta travel about with a bail. Sa Alicia had bit upon a rather novel seheme. For twa nigbts now at \"The Elms\" she bad moumted a chair and dived into bed from it, snapping off the light after- ward from the switch above ber bead. This proceeding, whilc covardly, bad at least the menýt of ariginality and tbough she spent the first five minutes or so i listcning with straining ears for an y sounds which might'corne rom beneatb her, she soon dozed off and al ber fears were forgatten in sweet dreamrless -lumber. It was Sunday nigbt. The day bad been a, quiet anc as compared with the twa preccdinig 'G and the guests bad retired rather Alicia and ber hostesse-and severalyof the other girls Drt Francia, Ont.). ,fhfad cbatted themselves isleepy in Elaine's rdressing room and separated sbortly after seleven for their respective nests.

It was 1tbe pictune of a yaoung mail. She could not bave stated in bold words just wbat there was about the young man that arrcsted ber attention every time she happened ta glance up at bimn. He was not bandsomne. Yet there was a rugged sort of cbarrn about bim she could not define. He bad whimsical eyes and a pleasant looking, though large, mouth, and broad shoulders., His taste in cravate' seemed rather extraordinary. But after ahl that was a minor dlefeet and easily cured. The ane be was weanin-g in the picture was a large-pattcrned affair. Sbe boped the colors wcrc quiet, for the stnipes certainly werc not. Tbey fairly shouted at the passerby. \"Looks like as if it lhad been'cut from the side of a zebra,' reflected Alicia,i \"but, ob-hasnt lie got the loveliesti eyes? lIl ask Flaine who be is first1 tbing to-morrow.\" i And with this dctcrmination in ber1 mind, Alicia Nvawned agaiin and, stcppingv out of ber blue,-ilk mules, began ta drawe a chair over to the bedside.t \"l'Il sav iny prayersin bcd to-nîglit,\" Y sbe thouglithif giiiltily ' \"and I suppose V'Il bave to put in a word about comfort C for detir old inother and the girls, for it ccrtaili- in to bc a huge disaippoint- Ji ment for them- when I go ho'Ze TueBday, without any-prospe.je She 'sighed and began to slip off hier isilk dresslng-gown. To think that ifter ail there was ta be no brother-in-law for Patricia, Felicia and Justicia! -The Men of the house party we~qie 6f caurse-that is, the most af-ýthem.

At the picnie the following day the M.P., who m-îs addicted ta poker, sat beside ber in the car, and afterward stuck ta her dloser than a brother or a burr, but ail his conversation was of kings and aces, and \"full bouses,\" and \"flushes.\" Cn the Saturday night at the bail Alicia had had many partners and a falrly good tmbut somehow, when it came te fancye any one of that çuta-way- coated assemblage -sitting opposite ta ber at the breakfast table each morning, for the rest of bier natural life-well, Fer rather vivid imagination just couldn't picture such a scene. Sigblng again, from the very deptbs of ber beart, Alicia mounted the littie gilt-and-satin chair and, placing her bands togetber in the attitude of bigh-clivers, counted one-two- thrce-go!-and Ieaped into the bed., Crash! For one brief startled second Alieia tbougbt that an eartbquake bad oceW~red for the sback had been sQ very sudden. Then, Iaughing sbakily she tried ta regain lier feet. It was tÈen that another sound broke the stlness. Common sezise told Alitia that the bedsprings bad flallen, but-gracious heavenf! bad ber. èars deceived bier or did she bèar-a m.ah's voice? Gasping faintly, she managed to si up and clutcb at the bed-rail. Horrox-s! Something was moving underneath the rnattress, samething huge and squirmy! A man? Nonsense! It was a dog probably, but then a dog would bave elped. What an earth was it? Alicia's eart paunded. Somre live thing assured- Iy was pinned beneath the debris. \"Help! help!\" she called, weakly. And then came the sound once more- a cross between a groan and a laugh. Words followed. \"I say, would you mind-er---just getting up you know, sa that I can-e- oh, tbank you so, much!\"l 'The lest five words were'uttered in a aone of obviaus and immense relief. Oct up? Oh, ycs, Alicia would get up, it vas no vcry great pleasure ta sit there holding down a man. deHelp, belp!\" she quavered again, as bhe made haste ta get ta the door, but ier voice seemed only a wbisper. Her limbs trembled under bier. She was afraid to look back. She snatched up ber (lressing-gowil and donned it bastily.

The ther was at ber cheek baif covering onc Eye. He had spaken politely. That Tas perhaps what made bier pause. But 'en Raffles was polite, tao. She sent tburried glance in the direction of tbe )ed---or wbat had recently been a bed.

They represent very ancient customs of devotion or superstition, which, like the disaster QJ spilling sait or sitting thirteen at a table, are persisting reliecs of a tixne when the world was filled with signs and1 omens. And so I mean in this article to only give a few of 4he \"Little Things about Easter' that have corne to me in various ways in the co 1ý\"e of my reading. The Name Easter To a tudent of the world's history there is great interest and food for thought in the facts coneerning the origin of Easter. Étrange enough it may seem, this popular cburch festival dates back to a heathen custom. In Anglo-Saxon language, this feast was ternied \"Eastre,\" and was held at about the same time as the Christian festival. The goddess Ostara seema to have been regarded as the personification cf the bc- ginn ing of spring. The worship cf this goddeaa was brought te our ancest ors in Great Britain from Northern Germany in the earjy centuries. It is well known that the. Anglo-Saxon name of April is or was Estermonath, and in Gerrnany this month is still known as Ostermonath. Easter ia the -modern English equivalent for the Saxon.word \"oster\" or \"osten,\" meaning rising. The German word is \"ostern,\" the Hebrew form is \"pascha,\" the Frenchi \"paques,\" the Scotch \"pasch,\" the Dutch \"epaschen \" the Swdih \" paskz,\" and the Danish ipaaskze.\" Îfhe cominon word in the East was the \"paschal fcast,\" because kept. at the same time as the paschen, or Jewish Passover, and in somne measure succeeding it. In the sixth cf the Ancyran canons it iii called \"The Great Day.\" .The reader wiil perhaps be able te gather from thia some idea as to wby we cail this great religioua fcast Eastcr. The Modern Celebration The coronation cf Christendom is cx- pressed in the phrase, \"1 amn the Rcsur- rection and the Life.\" Triumph is the' keynote cf Eastertide. A few weeks ago, whole forests. showed their tracery o bough and twig without a single leaf. The felds were bidden under the sniow. There was an aspect cf austerity and silence in the familiar landscapc. As if Nature were waiting for something te bappen, she with- drew herscîf from sight, and dweit in mystery Eand reserve. But earth has felt au ellemenfal thril. Nature has heard the comnmand, \"Corne forth!\" and is obeying the promptings cf the resurrection pulse throbbing in ber veins. The vernal fields, the bursting buds, the day springing out of darkncss are ail reminding us of }1im that burst the tomb. Ea.ter is a day cf hoiy memories. The sun shines upon an open grave and into it, flooding out its darkncss. The Sun of a neiv ighteousness cornes with wings cf healing, and death loses its ating and its bitterness. The resurrection has its message for every age. In the midst cf doubt, and the helpiesa speculation of our own time, and the love of the temporal that seema4o crewd out spiritual realities and the scase of the life to corne, it is somcthing te know t hat the gospel cf Christ liftcd the vision higher; that H1e ennoblcd this world with t he glory cf the next; that He made turne eternai and gave the. duties and responsi- hilities cf turne the significance and doter- rnining valuie cf eternity, and this is the r-ssageocf Easter te us. Observance of Lent A Pagan Custom Athough Lent bias the elaimn of Christ- ian origine Lewis, who hLs delvod deoply into the history cf pagan customs, asserta that it is of very ancient enigin. It aroqe, -noarly as bas been determnined, in the f'tsting that was dustcmnary amnong the T\u003ch vlonians, whosc worship forrnid the f-' rting point cf Ea8ter. Tho fast ivaq 000 ~vmpqthv ith th(, goddess of repro- S*i en. çho rnourned hor es-ort. an~d fhe period was marked by fasting arýà an àab- stinencelromfnirth and social festivals. - Fasting has béen a widesprèad custonm. Humboit, the noted traveller, found the Mexicans observing fast days when he visited that country many years ago, Landseer mentions fasting anxong the K, EUyptians and it is still a customn arong the tribes in Kurdistan. In civilized countries theme is to-day in severai cf the churches a season cf com- parative abstinence, and its effects are feit in a commercial way by amusement en- terprises and confectionera. Few per- sons in these churches will marry in Lent, while leccasionally theme persista some custom that has placed restrictions on in- dividual action, as in Hungary, wbcrc it is forbidden te make love on Easter Eve. From Ash Wednesday te Good Friday, we may if we ill, o into etreat from the ol, shake oits duat, compromise with its care, and seek tbeblessedness cf Heaven.' Swiftly after the gleom cf Good Friday with its memeries. cf the Cross, follows Easter Day with its memories cf the Crowu. Easter Flowers Easter is the season for flowersalal ovex the world. Perhapa the eai reason is that this most joyous festival cf the Christian ycar happfly coincides with the returu cf apring and the fuiler pulse cf life when ail tbe werld is bursting forth into a glad éx- ultant rneod. It cornes just as the warmth approaching spting has.. caused te blcs- soin forth the first blooms since the win- ter's icy blast made bare the fields.--, Aftem the gloom cof a long winter, Easter flowers are especially entrancing. To the invalide s èaecally, they bring hope and cheer. To he youthful, they teil tales cf budding love and fragrant joy. Té the children, they are the harbingers cf sun- shine,. fragrant fields. and dewy meads. To the aged, they bring gloriona promise- cf rejuvenation and hope eut beyond tbe evening star. They bring the Eater mir- acle into ail our lives, and whisper,,\"we camne eut cf the blaekuesa cf the soi]; why may net your dark and black pat also produce flowery bleois which may bles net ouly youmseives but others as .wel.\" Hundreda cf thousanda cf dollars are spent each Easter for flowers forchurchep., Loversanad sweetbearts excbange flowers at Easter, and in rnany a littie cottage on back streets cf every town and city i the land,- house plants fil hornely living oomas with perfume and brigbtness. To go back to an ancient use cf flowers at Easter, Gurber tells us that altars known as Easter astones may stili be sen in Gem- many, and up te tbe middle cf tbe nine- teonth century, at least, they were crcwncd with flowers, and the young people, and net infrequently the old, danced about thcm. The Sacredness of Fire at £aster \"Easter fimes cbntinue even now in Northern Europe,\" wote Grimm a gener- ation ago. On tbe Weser, a tar barrel was ticd te a fir tree-and lighted in the evening. Around this men and maidens danced-. Theme was a fire on every bill-top. rro- cessiouns te these firca and hyrnn siîîginr and the bcaring cf wbite roda were fcatUre:t cf thl-is ceremony. The people like te carry the fime home with themn because it was sacred fire and embodicd the elements of the old fircý-worship. It was produccd by friction and te kindie it two boys wcmo, sclected wbo knew nothing about t he van- ity cf the world. The sacredness cf ire was an element in latter worsip in Scot land and Imland, but the fine must bave bnnn car'ipd home from the Easter ceremonies on the moors and huis. In those couintrics the cemernony had te do with fcrtility. Giant Sacrlficfal Candie Tbe beat hen bonfimes cf the Weser w( re perpetuated in the paschal tapers wiffi which the eburches were once lighted on Easter eve. The brilliant illuminations cf the eitics cf Russia and othen Etiroprn counîtnies at Eastcr are aise mreminders cf tho narly heathen festivals.

The poor woman, relying implicitIy upon bier son's promise, bung a hot cross bun in the front room of the little cottage for him te partake cf when, as she antici- pated, be would rush with jeyous excite- ment into'the bouse. But the boy did nol corne; neither did any news cf him reach the sorrowing widow. Her faith in his promise, however, did net diminisb, and every Good Friday a bun wassbung in the room te gladden the eyes cf the wanderer if bie returned. The widow died witbout ever hearing a Sword cf lber son's whereabouts or fate, That was more than seventy years ago.

The.Easter Egg Thse Easter egg is the acceptance by, a modern festival cf an emblemthat is oldèr than any buman record. In the early systems cf Pbilosephy, the egg was already well established as .thse symbol cf life. When spring ret urned after the winter's deatb-preessely tbe import cf the Ishtar festival-the eldest ýf the nations used the egg te typify the nevý ife, just as the new- est nations do witbout knowing why. Easter eggs were colored ýo show the Joy cf the people at the reawakening cf the eartb, and were used in connection witb tbe spring Astarte festival clebrat ion. In ancient, as in modern times, tbe eggs bave varied from the simple uni-colored cnes te * creations in gold leaf and gorgeous tints. Everywbere, in ail ages, there bas been a spring festival and it bas been oelebrated witb eggB. Several superstitions have grcwn Up sround the Easter egg. One is tînt empty egg sheila are witches' gcbéto, and may be used te the harm cf him who ate the egg. Irish and Englisb cbildren are taught fo put the spoon througli the egg shell. Leaping Hare EmblemnaticetfEaster The Easter hare cornes te us from tbe Germans, the home cf Kris Kringle who was gifted witb anonymous fairy gifts. In many parts cf Germany tbe customn pre- vails cf hiding eggs in tbe garden at Enster time. The children who find them are told that tbey are laid by the hare. In other parts cf the samne country and at other times than Easter, bread is hidden in the same fashion, te whicb the naine bare bread is given. Easter and the hare have a number cf strings te conneet them. Ostara iked the haro because cf its fecundity and it became emblernatie cf lher. It would naturally tIen be conaected witb Easter. Then again the leaping haro is the emblem cof spring- time in the lore cf many nations, and this is renson enough for its presence in this festival cf spring. 'Jack\u003c'and Ji\" Have £aster Connec- tien When \"Jack and Jiil\" went up the hill together for water they may have been p ursuing a devotional act connected with Eater. Their jcurney far antedates the name Easter, cf course, yet it may have had its origin in a practice that Easter 4 cerem onies bave perpetuated. It.vas the custom on the Continent for the youths and maidens on Easter mcmn- ing te go together up into the mountains te the hcly springs for water, whicb they hrought home with them. Suc1 a custem is undoubtedly the survival cf an eider Pagan one, and it relieves Jack cf somne criticisrn fer going up the bill for the watem. If it was a water-worship observance, Jack was riglit. In this Easter mcmning water seeking, thore is a, reieocf water w6rship,' for springs, being direct gifts cf the gods te inon, miraCulcus gifts, were more sarred than brooks or wells.

In the far East the star of Portugal vas already setting, and that of 'Hofland vas rising to its short-lived brilliancy; and only five years had passed -since Queen Eliza- beth had signed thé charter of the Merchant Adventnrers, trading te the lequntries of the Indies, whieh laid the. foundation-stoiie of the empire of Brit- ish India..,- The Duteli adventurers in the East were, like their Engliali r$vals, nmer- chants first of al. It was with no Idea of found.ing empires like those of the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru that the thrifty burghers of Antwerp and Iýotterdam sent thoir vessels to the .siatic Archipelago and took possession of Java. To exchange the goods of Europe -for the spiees and gold, the pearîs and preciaus stones of the East vas the objeet with whicb they set ont, and the purpose from whieh they allowed nothing else seriously to divert their attention. It was to this that, folland owed the honor of having been- iLe flrst to discover the last« of the continents, and perhaps it may have been ta this alsa, that she owed it that allie discovered it for others and not for herself. The good ship fluyffhen (or Dove) sailed from Batavia, early in the year 160.5, on a tradiing voyage among the southern isiands of what is naw known as the Malay or 'Asiatie Archipelago. She certainly would not have been called a ship xowadays, and even then she vas perbaps not istrictly entitled ta the titie. She vas a cnrious-looking vessel witfh two masts, witli a low deck and bulwarks for about halfflier length in the middle, and a high poop and fýorecastie at the sterm and bow. It was long before the age of clipper ships, and the Duyffhen had no pretensians ta be considered a quick sailer, but \u0026lhe was looked upon aa a suitabie vessel for an adventurous voyage juta un- known seas, and as onc that could be used alike for trading and defending ' herseif. ~Batavia, from whlch she salied, vas a new port, but it hall been selected, as t'lic capital of the Dutch possessions in the East, and even then had become the centre of the trade in spices, which was Vlhen, and indecd haa ever since been, the ehief tradt of Holland in that part of the world. Trading for spices sounds nowadays a very peaccable and coin-6 inonplace kind of thing, but it vas a8 r very \u003cifferent business wbien the crewvst of the ships of the Dutch advcnturersV took their lives in their bauds ta carryd it on. In 1605 vory littie indleed was known of the Maiay Archipolago. The best charts in existone-and we may be sure the Oaptain of the Duyffhen was suppliid with anc of theso--showedL onlv the south'èrn end of thec Malav i Peninsula, part of thc coast of Sumatra,e and one or two outiying points of Ce!e- l hes, besides an impcrfec't outinfe of Java i itself and a few srnailer islands.

The table looked swvcct and ternpting, in spite of the oid chipped china; the sceut of the roses lîad overcomne the unwhole- some fustiness whieh bad grceted my entrance. I threw open the window, and then, after a final survey of my handi- work, was about to slip quictly off -home again, thinking it best tlîat my friend (as I had corne to cali hlm in nîy own mind) sliould introduce bis little xnaid to ber new borne alone.ý But my plan was frustrated, for even as I paused for the last glance round I* heard a four- wvheeler drive up to the gate, and in- mediately the front door was flung open as a voies cried ont qnickly: 1 fiýrt#r consoled bler by spendi qtIrele weeks of the summrer vacation withbher in Wçstport.\" Hia voice grew drearnily rerniniscent. \"'Three whole happy weeks away by the sea-alone with My littie l3arbie.\" Hie sigied wistfully.- \"Madanj, you can- not ecnneive wbat those weeks of bright-ý jiess meant te me-stolen, as it were, frorn a whole ypar of duli, lonely ones- for a solitary old man to hear the glad tones of welcorne in a young voice; to have a wealth of ]ovin- affection warrn- ing the coldnessa of Lis lipart!

'q must really apologise for troubling you, but -you were go very kind and-syrn. pathetie. I thank you for your syrnpathy,. but now 1 must not take up any more of your time.\" And with a quiet bow 'lie took up the oid black bag and left the rooni. As I watcbed the slight figure move stiffly dowu the garden patb, I realized afreq'h the bitterness of his life-sorrow, and I asked myseif bow it would al end. Must bis brave spirit be defeated at iast, tbe cbapter of love bèelosed before bie had «fully experienced its sweetness ? With a sigh 1 turned away to take up again the everyday duties of my own more prosaic life. But tbough I fouéId many things te occupy my time and attention during thé next few days, the littie old man, 'with lis pitiful story which prornised so sad an ending, was often in my mind. To-morrow bis granddaugbter would leave hier ligbt-bearted, girlish school- days bebind, and would take up a worn- an's heritage of disappointment and sorrow. The loyal. wbole-bearted trust of a young heart in the one being she loved best would be rudely shaken, ber youing eyes opened te the faitb-sliatter- ing possibilities of duplicity, even though the motive bad been kind. I rernembered bis description of the smnall, dreary rooms in tbe ebeap littie lodging to whicb lie would bave ta bring tlie girl, and I resolved that at least they sliould boive a little welcoming 'briglîtness ta meet ber disillusioned eyes. Early in the afternoon, therefore,1 1 set off, arrned with a basket of sweet- srnelling roses, and another of tempting dainti4s for the tired travellers. The door was opened ta my knock by a frowsy, iired-looking woman, wbo, in answer to my request te bc allowed to enter Mr. Austin's roam, gave a listless assent, and, throwing open a door at the side of the narrow passage, usbered nrie into a duli, cheerless little room. \"Yes,\" abe said in answer to my in- quiry, \"I expect 'ern home in time for their tea.\"1 I glanced towards the littie round table, whieh showed signs of preparation for tea in the shape of a soiied table- cloth, a glass sugar-baqin. and two cups, c.racked and chipped atthe brirns.

Problems,\" the keeping of profitabi( utllity birds of a. good bred-to-laj '\u0026train was urged rather than invcstin, ln show birds of fine type and feather but uncertain egg production. J. E Burgey, -of the M. A. C. followed witll an excellent talk upon \"Poultry Farms, their succoss and failure. He considor. ed good management the keynote ol succoss in chicken farming; choosinge poor locality and lack of a good ex. perience in poultry raising, weo er mon causes of failure. The speaker con- sidered Manitoba offered many facili- ties for success in poultry. A good market could be socur6d for broilers, roasters and fresh eggs. In an interest- ring way,, John Guest, manager of the T. Baton Co.%s meat department, Win- nipeg, traced the growth of the indus- try of buying mnarket poultry for the ý4last fine years f rom farmers in the country. Many changes had come about and great improemont in dressed birds was noticed, especially sinco fthc city liad altcrod the bylaw, which liad de- manded only drawn birds were te bo exposod for sale. The day of dark colorod, scalded poultry was past, and farmors were fattening and finishin\u0026 their stock btter, thanks to Professor Jierner and lis department. Thore is need, however, of muoh missionary 'work yet among theo growers, too xnany poorly fieshed birds flood theo mnarkot in early winter. The egg marketing problem n'as the subjeet diiscoursed upon by Messrs. Haro and Allen, Dominion Poultry De- partmont, Ottawa. It is interesting-to hlear thait Canada wiich was importing eggs in 1913, now lias enougli eggs for home consuxnption and exported several million dozen in 1915. This present time, when Great Britain lias man' sources of lier supply eut off, wi prove a. golden opportunity for Canada in advancing lier egg trade, providing a gilt-odge article is exported te Eng-' land and inferior eggs kept at home. KCanadian eggs now stand fourth on the list in theo Engliih market, Danish flrst, t.hen flutch and I'rish, then Cana- dian. The anadian eggs scl for 4 cents per dozen more than the Ameni- (dfl egg at prosent. Mr. Allen is in this Pro-vince organizing co-operativo poul- Iry an d egg associations. Egg circles 'i!b omdin several centres and be(tter prices will ho roalizod by the rroducer, of a strictIv first class ar- tIie. \"fireat success h*ad attonded the to-operativo fattening of poultry at the college li.tvinter,\" isaid Pro fesser a-Herner, who 'told of the workizi of the J-schemne, SbÉeen- hundred birds of the sheavier breeda liad 'been aent in by w farmors to be fattened for 3 weeks ai; i- the college. These eold fromn 16 cents )f te, 25 centspdTf'1b. wheu dressed. The le profeseor aleo stated later on egg cir- « cles and co-operative fattening stations 'y could lbe 1inKed up and the stations iewhieh séould handie 3,000 birds could 'esecure feed grains direct from the far- 1 mier. The eos't of handling birds runs !s te 12 and 15 cents eaci, feed esting 's 7 to 10 centa per head. This is ail good news to both the producer and consumer and surely lie time is eom.ing for syetematie liandling of botri drealsed poultry and eggs. The statisties of Canadian eggs, the kind used for home consumptiion, is not pleas- ant re-ading, 33 per cent -are fresh, 40 per cent slightly stale, 17 per cent very stalo, 5 per cent broken and 5. per cent bad. The-se figures were givbn by Messrs. Tiare and Allen at the congres. The annual poultry show took place from Feli. 15th to, î9th In the Central Farmers' Market. Over 1,000 birde of most aristocratie conneetion and pure 1!neage were exliibited and how proud and grandi they looked in eU their fine feathers. The show we asplendiâ suçees. from every point of view witih an attendance very gratifying to the hard.working of-* ficers of the association. tSuch magnifi-, cent birds, someo f the f inest ever ahown. in Wiqnnipeg, were well worth a visit to the show. One pleasing feature te west-- cmn people was that the greater number of the prize winners wore reared in this country, showing that our rigorous climate is no hindrance to the growth of fine stock. The 1argýst exhibit was in tée 9Buff Orpington cias, 130 birds, chiefly shown by Winnipeg fanciers and such beauties tliey were. P. J. G.

By Dr. Leonard Keene Hirshberg, A.B., M.A., M.D. (Johns Hopkins University) Sleep, the uncomfortable bird that broods over ýthe troubled sea ýof infants, whose mothers dnd fathers refuse to learn or te do what is best fqr them, la the most conciliatory of ail the mnucli courted physi- cal debutantes. This strange state of being, senseless to feel and with sealed eyes to see, hovers like angels around a baby's bead, yet faulty food, irregular feeding, home remedies, soothing syrups, rocking, bouncing, walk- ing the floor, and showing a child off to relatives and visitors, ah màke for such a disturbance of nature's own rhythm, that the gentie thing disappears and the mon- ster, sleeplessness, takes its place. Infants should always sleep alone, and in a crib. Not only does this calm. their daylight spirit and ruffled nature, but it obviates the chance of bad habits, such as rocking, contact with others, contagious diseases and similar things. Systematic regularity of the cbild's bed-tixne; feeding at the precise turn of the clock's hands; absolute quiet between turnes, and exact moments for the youngster's toilet. If the baby la very young, it should be Urepaxed for a f ull nigbt's sleep at 5 30 efore every feedîng. If it bas9 had a fi morning bath, a thorough sponge and wash may be given it and ahi its linens changed. Then it la fed or nursed and put to bed. At ten o'clock at night, or, according to the age of the infant, it should be agamn fed after wbich tbe child should sleep until six or seven a.m. Most infants, unless their p ower of sleeping bas beent-interfered with by pr- ents, relatives, or faulty foods, wih .sleeèp all night. Contrary.to most notions about babies, darkness and uriet at night are conducive to sleep. î the waiting and crying of a well child is flot catered to if the heaithy infant la not taken up to Ïeel the warm fiesh of the niother or nurse, it soon acquires the ability to make the best of its uncomfortable situation and faUls soundly asleep. It is no uncommon experience te find babies of ten and eleven months in well- trained homes, so thoroughly established in its nocturnal habits that it sleeps from earlyevening until six or seven in the morn-, ing. Indeed it la a refiection upon the knowhedge, the wiil and the eneryoth mother and guardianà. o h It la considered best to have infait sleep after the mornine bath and the ten a.m. feeding. This tine shouhd be set aside for sleeping. The crib should b. fresh and clean,the roem, previously well aired, now dark and as quiet as night. Begun'at birth and steadily continuad, it will be found that the ittle banibino, if correctly fed,, wl1 sleep tbree hours. -There is no more certain antidote to ir- nitability, muscular restlessness, twitch- ings, crossness anid other so-called ner- vousness in cbildren, tban regular hours of sieep.

U.\u0026h Mogul 8-16--An Everyday Tracte,- Last season eighteen Mogul 8-16 kerosene tractors went into onc neighborhood. Sometime later we made a thorough canvass of the owners to find out what kinds of work they were using their tractors for, and to get figures on the comparative cost of kerosene and horses aa farm power producers. You wil be interested in the report of that canvass. Tho.e eighteen farmers, among them, hiad used the M9ogul 8-1l' for elvery klnd 0f farm work they had ever used horses for, except cultivating a growing crop. That proves the everyday usefulness of the Mogul 8-16. The report on comparative costs showed the net profits of *very fa increased by the use of Mogul 8-16. The littie kerosene tractor did its work cheaper than the best records of gasoline tractors, and at much les cost than horses. The big advantage of Mogul 8-16 is that it uses iow grade, low priced, kerosene, benzine, napbt ha, or miotor spirits for fuel. The farmer who owns a Mogul 8-16 ia always sure of a plentiful supply of low priced fuel. Because of this feature, and because of its general usefuiness on smail andlrefms Mogul 8-16 ia selling fast in Canada. gefrs A line to the nearest braneh house wilI bring you full i nforrmation.

Millions of dollars were sent by these princes to hel p swell the British exchequer. Great Britain accepted the Indian offer because it could not be refused.

         "The Western Home Wntl Cow Gives Nine Quarts DaIIy Fifteen years ago an assistant in the dairy department of the University of Missouri began ýto keep tecord of the nilk and butter productiir of a small Jersey cow. This 'assistant lias gone and ôthers biave came and gone, but the Jersey cow is still on the job. In 1 '5 years she has produced 108,068 pounds of milk and 5,000 pounds of, but- ter fat, or 5,833 pounds of butter. Her best year's record was 13,322 pounds of milk and 730 pounds of butter. During the 15 years this cow, Grace :riggs, lias given birth ta 12 calves. lBer iast caif- sold for $300, and the av-: erage for the 12 is about $200. About $2,400 was obtained from the sale ai ail the calves. Figuring the entire xilk production for 15 years at eight cents a quart, the total would be $4,- 358.72. The approximate cost ai keep. ing lier wvas $50 a year, or a total of $750. The average daily production oi niilk for the 15 years was a little more than nine quarts. During her best year she produced a little more than 18 quarts a day. If the butter was sali instead af the milk, at the price of 35 cents a pound, the total for the butter production from Grace Briggs would bie $2,041.55.

Erseruni% Turkish EtronZhold, Falls to Czar's Forces Erzernrn, the chief city of Turkish Armenia, has fallen before the assault of the Russians, and is now occupied by the victors. Grand Duke Nicholas, in chief command of the Rus. sian forces, in the Caucasus. bas telegraphed the Czar of the victory. The capture of Tur- key's northcrn stronghold is considered of great strategic importance. Fromn the city, roads radiate in all directions, and it is thought that with Erzerurn as a base of supplies the Rus- sians will b. able to corne to the relief of the besieged British in Kut-el-Amara.

The Poultry-House Floop iProvided the floor is kept coveredl with litter, as it should be, it really does not make a great deal of differ- ence what, kind of floor je in use. A floor cf dirt will give as good results as any, if the dirt inside the bouse is raised at least six inches above the sol outside the building. Many dlaim that a. dirt floor will be unhiealthful unless tîwc or three inches cf the top soul ie removed frequently and replaced with fresh dirt. If the floor ie kept welI littered and the litter renewed as often as lb, becomes reduced to short lengths, very' little cf the droppings vil become mixed with the earth. The lit- ter wiii absorb the greater part of the. liquid portions cf the droppings. Wr1here earth floors are used, it ie ad. visable te hbave the bouse rest on a con- crete or stone vail that extends twelvo or fifteen inches under the ground.

Wallowing in dust ie the hen's Ë*atural method of ridding herself of vermin. If the poultry-house floor is of eârth, the best method is to set aside a sunny corner as a dusting place for the hensé. This corner should be boxed off f rom the rest, of the floor with ten or twelve'inch boards to prevent the lhens ecratching it ýull of litter. Road dust, dry garden loam or sift- ed coal-ashes rmake good dusting ma- teniaIs. The dust, as a killing agent, is greatly improved if a pound or two of tobacco dust, sulýhur or Persian in- sect powder is occasionally mixed with it. T. Z. R. Soils Lose Food The farmers are fast recognizing the fact that each crop which is harvested removes from the soil certain plant- food elements wvhich must be replaced if crop yields are to be maintained. If cave is not taken to Keep the soul fer- tile by putting back these forms of plant food that have been removed, it has been f ound that smaller and srnaller crops will be obtained. The four elements removed by grow- irig crops wiiich oftentimes exist in such limited quantities that they must be replaced, if the crops are to con- tinue to do their best, are nitrogen phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, or lime. The nitrogen is found in the humus, or decaying vegetable matter of the soul, while the other elements are found principally in minerai comn- bination. The following figures show the amount of plant-food which is re- 'noved from the soul by the different crops, the value of this plant-food be- ing measured in termis of what it woultl cost if purchased as a comm~er- cial fertilizer. An Appeal from the Honorgble the Minister of Agriculture of Manitoba Winnipeg, Marchi 8th, 1916. Editor, 'Westegn iomne Monthly,. Winnipeg'. Dear Sir, - At the present moment one of the most acute, problems 'before the farmers of Manitoba is the securing of a suffiient supplyiof farm laborers to meet the demands of the seasoii just opening. ]3elieving that thie niost p;omising, and alrnost the onlv, outside source of supply at present is in the United States, the Maniitoba Department of Agricul- ture and Immigration is seeking, tlirough its St. Paul agency, and through an active advertising cam- paign in varjous parts of the ' United States, to stimulate a northward movement of just as many farmers' sons and experi- eneed farm laborers as possible. In this connection I wish to ap- peal to ail thoseitizens of Mani- toba who, having corne from the United States or otherwise, having formed an acquaintance south of the international boundary line. can hielp us to get into touch withi experienced farm lielpers there who mighit be induced to corne 4o Mani- toba this season. I have no doubt that many of our people could sup- ply the names of such persons; and in ail cases where this is done, miy Departnient will see that an appeal is mnade to them, and if possible they will be ihduced to corne to this province. I would ask ail sucli correspondents to kindly address their letters to the Immigration Branch, Departrnent of Agriculturc and Immigration, Winnipeg.- Sincerely yours, V. WINKLER, Minister of Agriculture and Immigration. Twenty bushels of Wheat will re- move fromn the soil 25 pounds of ni- trogen, 12.5 pounde of phosphorue and 7 pounds of potash, with a fertil- -izer value of $4.91. The straw ire- moves 10 pounds of nitrogen, 7.5 J3ounds of phosplhorus, ant4 28 pounds of' potash, with a fertilizer value of $3.33. The entire wheat crop, unless the fertility r moved ie replaced. takes fertility out of the soil valued at $8.24, nearly one-haîf of it being removed by the straw. In a similar way, a fifty-bushel oat crop will remove fertility worth $11.06, sixty-five bushels of corn con- tain plant-food worth $7.96 in thïe grain and worth $7.94 in the staîks, or nearly twice the total amount re- moved by the wbeat crop. Two tons of cloyen hay will remove plant food worth $4.56. This is the commercial value of the potassium and phosphor- us. removed, for the dloyen plants, throughi the medium of tiny bacteria living in nodules on the rootiets, leave the soul richer in nitrogen. It is anerror, however, to believe that cloyen is the remedy for an exhausted soul if more than nitrogen is needed, for it cannot turn back the pliospiior. us and potassium which lias been re- mioved, by preceding crops. A \"crop of -).0 bushes of- potatoes will remove plant-fo)od- worth $11.05. The* aver- age yield of fiax, which Le supposed to he harder on the soil than other crope, removes plant-food worth $10.80. Certai n general figures can be drawn4 f rom the above- estimates. Theý cropj whjch removes the least plant-food- according to its commercial value-isi the two-ton clover 'crop, which removes1 potassium and phosphorus $4.56. Thei 65-bus *hél corn crop and the stover re-1 move -from the soul plant-food worth1 $15.90,ý the largest amount taken out1 hy any of the crope nentioned.

A smali amount of. milI- feed purchased and fed-' to swine, or dairy cows, will usually eupply the fertility lost by selling the milk and live-stock.

The gosiings, as she said, would brýng fuil-goose prices by the holidays, and ln most places they couid be.,marketed un- plucked, for tirrget practice. It is wise for the impatient to pur- chase geese rather than eggs, and to select a laying strain, like the Toulouse, although the African type, crossed with full-blooded Embden, grows to monster size and gives a f'air number of eggs, the cross resulting in an individual un- surpassed for grace outside the swan pa-rks. Preferably, stock up iu the faîl, that the home-loving mother.goose may becorne accustomed to her new quarters, a straw-lined box or barrel, no matter 'what or* where-aud deposit her eggs there. Geese wll wiuter on next ta nothing, even in aur frozen nerthern climes. A bunch of hay, thrown down fresh everv inealtirne, or fed from racks, that they iay not run over and foui it; a root or two, a hondfiul of grain to prevent their losing fiesh, is ail that is necessary.

There are rnany complaints of the wicked- ness of man, but it seems they like the fast traveller. I have known some niee girls to turn down the steady gbing fellow. and go with the sport. 0f course, I 'don't say al girls are alike. There is no doubt that many a young man would forsake sorne of his bad habits if his lady friend had the right influence over hirn. S. Now, ail bachelors are not dirty and many are excellent cooks, but I've* had almost enougli of it, baching over five cears now. If things don't soon improve, Iwill b.ajza. to try sornething else.

This Colun for Bacholor Maida and moen Sask., Feb. lSth, 1916 Dear Editor,-I notice ini the February issue an appeal for a more practical type of letters'for this column. Surely some space cari be spared for the nonsense of bachelor imaids and men. \"Valley Flower\" thinks a long terrn of baching will make a man cranky. I think she is miàstaken. If anyofie does know how to appreciate a good wife and home it is a man who has bached and homesteaded, as \"Single Handed\" points out. What does any oth- erman know about the triais of a house- keeper? Being a homesteadefand bach- elor, I can conflrm the statemnent of \"A Happy Rube,\" who says county boys like brainy and sympathetic girls. At least anbitious ones. I expect ini the future to be able to provide a home for some sucli girl. As for that type of girl which refuses to recognize a man in overails, my respect for them rapidly sinica, as I have discovered that they are the ones who generally make fools of themselves. They apparently think they are a gold mine and every one ia after them (delusion). Most of my ac- quaintances are different, I arn glad to say, and are ladies in the true sense of the word. However, I do kIaow a few higli- headed ones. As my homestead is about forty miles frorn town, I sometirnes get rather lonely. A few correspondents gained froin your pages would help sorne, so I w111 live in hopes and leave my address with the Editor. Rocky. Why Women Should Vote Manitoba, Feb. 2, 1916. Dear Editor,-There is one part of the letter from \"Prairie Nurse\" that I can't quite agree with and that hs where she says wornan shouldn't have the vote. There is one question I would like to a8k: \"What harmn is there in it?\" Why should awoman not have some thing to say about the laws that are to govern her children after they have grown up and gone out in- to the world ? Don't you think that a wornan knows more about what a man or womnan needs? Now some people say tat a woman wouldn't know what she was voting for. Now, that ia not quite true. At any rate she has more pride in lier than to 'seU her vote as sorne men do. 1 guesa I will close, hoping to see rny lettcorinaprint. I will be pleased to answer ahlctters. A Beulabite.

And I say, girls, stay with the boys who can avoid these bad habits. I quite agree with what \"Just a Boy \" saysa in January issue on this subject.

I cannot skate very good, neither can I-danoe, but intend to learn. It is very quiçt around here in wintor turne, as there are not many young people, but we try Vo put in the time some way.
