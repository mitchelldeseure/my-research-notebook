Improve the conditions withiu, and we willl have no fear froni without.', \"Internai improvements, in which the plain people have a deep and immediate in- terest, -rather than a remiote one, will do more to keep us a happy, closely united, and contented people than ail the subsidies paid to railroads, to mail-ships'and- stcam- ships, to tariff subsidies and high duties laid on the one least able to bear and for the benefit of the class least in need. I tell you, sir, the Amenican people will not sit idly by'and be grouud down by inequalities and ï1uiquities içfr which you can give no good or adequate àuswer. \"Millions for.post-offices and public build- ings for a few towus of the country and no assistance for' the post-roads and the little towns, will not'satisfy theni, and is wrong as well. \"You have arrauged tariff schedules for the manufacturer, so that his riches are greater than he ever anticipated. You have subsidized the railroads with 'Iand grants until they have grown corpulent with wealth. You have.increased the appropri- ations for the war -and navy until,the patience of this 'citizenship is almost ex- hausted, and uow, when asked to do some- thing for the -plain citizen, who produces more every y caT than hle hiruscîf consumes, this bill will, anà deserves to be, the most popular bill passed. Lt is the starting of a great improvemeut that will go on and on after we are gone.1 We shall ail be proud of the begiuning.\" Out of Work One authority estimates that in New York city there were tbis winter 350,000 people out of work. In Pbiiadelphia the figure was -placcd at 75,000; lu Wasbington at 15,000. Chicago, with more destitute than ever before in its history bas 150,000 idie. Rougbly speaking one lu tbirty of the wholc population of tbe United States is out of work. In Canadian cities there are like- wise tbousands of uncmployed. These in- clude those who had summer jobs ou fanms, and tbose who wcre occupied at summer trades. t may be that conditions are a little worse tban usual, but every wiuter wit- nesses sometbing of the saine kind. The pr3blem of continuous labor is one that m ust be solved if -the increase -in tbe army of bopelcss, bouselessmien is to be cbecked. If notbing cisc can ýbc dcvised tbere may well be institutcd for tbosc wbo are wortby a scbeme of insurance against uon-employ- ment. But not ail are wortby. To illustrate this consider this froni a reputable Ameri- can papcr. \"At Porfland 500 men wbo bad becu re- ceiving shelter at the expense of the city were offered work.

In other 'words, five of tbe unemployed, or 1 per cent of the total number receiving shelter, re- mainz-d at work long enougb to earn $1.50. \"At San Francisco the number of the un- employed is estimated at 15,000, but only 800 of tbem, or less than 6 per cent, appeared for work wben tbey werc given a chance to wield pick and shovel.\" A not!her paper eqùally reliable puts it ini this way:1 1. - \"LIt is -egsy.to conclpx4e that the uneni- ployed are -a worthless lot of loafers, but this is -not. so_; -hty Ae-.LaW1,sorts. In-the- treatment of criminals we are beginnùing to differentiate with a view to eclaiming those who çan be reclaimed; might flot a littie of the sanie careful inspection and testing be given to men whose only offence is- to be out of a job? Ont might aimost fancy that the aim of the authorities was to melce work so repulsive as to drive away as many as possible of -the men seeking it. Ln factories efficiency emperts have learned that mnen must be as carefully'selected fer the coarseheavy work as for fluor employment; even in a penitentiary convicts of delicate physique are set to the iighter tasks. But it 8CCRIS to be assuned that uinemploymefft auto- maticaliy gives the strength, knack, and en- diirance needed !or hard manual labor, or else* that only common laborers can be out of work.\" The more it i9 vonsidered, 'the more evident 'does- h seemn to be that society can- flot be built up on the foundation of pure individualism. Each for ail, is a principle that -must be recogniz ed if community life is to endure. Government as represeuting the community is bound to exercise bene- ficent watch care overî every individual, helping the distressed, caring for the. un- fortunate, -and the aged, isolating the dis- eased -aad the dangerous. Immigration from the Unitd States Theyý are getting quite excited in the Unitcd States over the exodus of good citizens to Canada. lit seenis that Can- adians -have been spending $W0,000 a year in advertising the advantages of the Western Provinces, and naturally thousands have been responding. Mr. William J. White, the Canadien Government's advertising agent, and a gentleman who is known to many -in our provinces, ;pleads guilty to the charge of advertising, and lias these very sensible words to utter lu extenuation of his off ence. \"Wehavedoue a great deal of advertising in Iowa with good resuits, but we have uot lassoed anybody, an~d I 'believe that on the wbole those who have gone toCanada -front Iowa have been benefitcd. Tbey sold their fanms in Iowa at a much higher price 'per acre than they couid obtain just as good lands for in Canada, and lu that way have eniarged their holdings, and I have heard Jittie or no complaint from theni. We try to aid would-be ciigrauts by pointing out the best agricultural lands and assisting thcm to locate.-\" It seenis that mauy of the Amnerican papers are making the bcst of the inevitable. Some are sayiug that there is a counter- immigration going on ail the tume, thougli this is denied by 'Canadian authorities, others are saying that it is well for settiers froni America to better their conditiou and at the sainie time to become factors -in sbapiug -the destinies of a -new laud. For instance the Washington Post says: \"She i s willing to give away land that isn\"t woxrth rnuch now, ýknowing that the only way it will ever increase in value is by populating the country. There are few of the restrictions against business there that exist here. Canada is advertising ber liberal policies and is reaping -the same reward that was reaped -by the United States wben our policies were mnore liberal than they are now.\" i.

Haviîig -expressed. quite de-. finitely mething about the char- acteristies of the Scotch, it will be in order to say something about the -English. I learned ometime ago, and liret hand impressions tend to confirm the view, that no people are likely tp give more surprises *than the English. The ,-,wýrprises n.4ay be antipodal, in their a- ture. Yç~ may take him at one time for a ISb man and get badly disap- pointed; or you may think him a stupid, prosy, non-committal, sort of a fellow and find on a test that hie is a marvel of resourcefulness and ability. You can't get the measure of an Englishman by' lii looks. Hia outward appearance is a conundrum. Tap him on the shoulder and ask for informat ion or give hlm smre responsibility and you will get a surprise one way or the other. That suggests two or three character- istics in wbich I think the people of the Motherland excel. First in self control. This registers itself everywhere, even amid the immeasurable activities of London. The officiais neyer appear to be bothered. Thinge are well organized, and are run by sehedule. At social functions we marked the case and compomure with which hosto and hostesses move about. At Eton, where over 1,000 lusty, vigorous boys-sons of English aristocrats and royalty-were in attendance we noted this trait; and it extended even to the play grounds. Put but a dozen Canadian bostogether, let alone a hundred or a thousand, and what are we likely to sec? You will likely see them punching each other's aides, pinching, tripping, grabbing caps, making remarks about people passing, and in a* hundred other ingenious or infernal ways letting off energies which they should in ail cen- science learn to control. Let it be rè- mcmbered that Wellington said: 'Eton won'Waterloo.\" The typical English- mnan is an adept at self discipline. A clever writer-has'characterizcd him as a fellow .who gets up early in the morning, takes a cold water bath the first thing, and* then-goca out to conquer the earth! It is due to these things that there ls, or appears to be, less individuality about the average Englishman than about the average Canadian. He in- herits traditions and customs quite diflerent fromn ourselves. One would need to live in the country to appreciate this. Away back there was feudalism wvhich worked itself into the character and mental attitudes of the people. The army discipline is always there-, and that invidious old-world class dÈtinction, with its accompanying snobbery. The Englishman has lcarned perforce to walk with hundreds and thousands by has aide. He lacks initiative, though history Wanted to Know The Truth About Grape-Nuts Food. It does't matter se much what you hear about a thing,, it's what you know that counts. And correct knowledge is most likely te corne from personal experience. \"About a year ago,\" writes an Eastern inan, \"I was bothered by indigestion, cspecially during the foenon tried several remedies without any permanent improvement. \"My breakfast usually consisted cf oatmeal, steak or chopa, bread, coffee an\u0026~ sorne fruit. \"Hcaring so much about Grape.Nuts, concluded te give it a trial. and find out Jif al I had heard cf it was truc. \",,Se I began with Grape-Nuts and eamn, soft boiled eggs, toast, a cup of Po tum and some fruit.

Men, of ài ranks tuinbled over each other'in thefr eagernesé te enllist. Sons of lords, generals. and famoiza novellis enrolled ring relief to isolated settlers or carrying te tradlng ponts. Up, much, utronger than that of the iMounted Police, with cannon, abundance of ammunition and provisions, and four times as mnany outlaws as there were epolice. Inside the smugglers stoekades was whiskey enaugh to win the whole Blackfeet confederaey as allies of the 1traders. The- first thing the police had to 'do was ta win the friendship of tih. Indiana. Colonel Macleod invited the kchiafato the new fort. They vere, e 'feated by the Police, given exhibitions of mlilitary skii, and shown the cannon. Pointing out a tree more than a mile away, the.Colopiel-bade the chiefs-watch it. The next instant a cannon bail tore bit up by the roots. That was a better shot than the old mortar over ai the is'mugglers' fort could make. The Blaek- feet.,were greatly impressed, and iheir visit marked the beginning of a friend- shoulder te shoiilder wlth cashlered \"Tommies\"a and Indian scouts; and curlously enough the mounted police retain the same heterogeneous elements to-day as when the firet enlistment took place. Immediately upon organization they started from Toronto ta Fargo by railway, and made a march to Dutferin, the beginning of their famous trek through 800 miles of prairie westward toward the Rocky Mountains, relying solely upon their own transport train for supplies. On October 10th, in the very heart of the Blackfeet country, where no mani's 1f. was safe, Fort Macleod, the firat mounted police fort in the West, wvas completed. Another force was sen1t north to Edmonton among the Assini- haines and Wood Crees. The-main body turned back acroais the plains to Fort PelIey, and thence to Dufferin. In four months the force bad travelled 1,060 miles, and had accomplished, without Ioss of life, that which had been delared as impossible without the use of en arxy-taking possession of the Great Lone LaW~. Barly Demonstration on Old Man River Fort Macleod, on the Old Mnn River wis a smugglers stronghiold, anidliere Colonel Macleod, after whorn the plaee wvas named, marked off a square for a fort on an island in the river. Cotton- wood logs were daubed with mud, white- washed oîitside and lined wiith cotton inside. Then the British flag was hoisted in opposition to the smugglers regime. Here then was a mocre handflîl of men surrounded 'by a con federacv of Indians noteid for thpir aggresqive ferneity. Not a day's ride distant was Fort Wiwol) ship between the Mounted Police and the Indians that has lasted ta the present day. Boundary Âlways Required Constant Patrol The end of open whiskey traffle did not mean that smulegling had entirely ceased. Iu those days, liquor was not only forbidden to the Indians, but pro- hibited ta white men throughout the entire territories, except by special government permit for smali. quantities. The duty of watching ail incoming freight, whether by pack train, ox-cart, or railway, feli to the Police. The most likely avenue of illicit trade was, of course, along the International Bound- ary, an imaginery line 1,800 miles long. with absolutely no settlement at its western end. The deep valleys and rolling hibis offered countlesa hiding places for smugglers, and only the mont vigilent patrobling could check the traffic. In summer time, with a good borne un- der him and frequent relays, this was pleasaut work for the scout; but when wintcr came with blinding blizzards, on fenceless prairies and a temperature that froze the mercury at forty below zero, tiiere w'as work to test the mettle af lieroes. Not long after Fort, Macleod was establislied, urgent oceasion ar-ose to seîîd a despatchi to a diqtant post itile soiîth, warning an offleer to be on the lookout for an ineoing despierado.

But on n condition eau a scout of Indien blood be .T...mp -ted -to -set -out-when -a storm -i. brewiflg. The choice fol! on a young man f rom a home of luxflry in an easteru city. Re was a good pathinder.ai$ï one of the Most trustedscouts. There was not yet much snow, s0 ho set out on horseback wlth snow shoes strapped to his knap- sack. The storm did not break for smre hours and it was hoped that he had reached the police post. A week passed, but he did( net return. Another mes- songer was sent andjie found that the firet had neyer reacehie destination. When spring came, by chance, a detach- ment set out for the north, and on their journey the boues of a saddled horse were found on the Ie side of a cîiff. Then it was remenibered that, on the night of the sceut's ride, the wind had veered to the south-east, and the rider, travelling by the wind, knew that it shoulà be on his back and turned north. The body was found on -the bank of the river, where his horse had evidently given eut. The brave fellow had pressed on tili the river bank told hlmt that ho ivas off the trail. Thon the long frost sleep had claimed hlm. Faithf ni Mount Savea Life of Troape Almost as unfortunate was another scout sent with a despatch to ono of tho smaller outposts. It was tewards spring, when the mid-day sun thaws the surface of the snow and the night frosts harden the melted cruats to a glare--of ice as dazzling bright as the blinding flash'of sunlight frem polishod steel. The thaw' had crusted over tho trail, and the scout had to keop-a sharp eye on the way not to loec the path altogether. Suddenly the mid-day sun developed extraordinary hues. Magenta, purpie, and black patchos began te dance on the snew, ai- ternately with wheels and rockets of cheese-colored lire. Then the light went black altogether, though the man knew that it was broad day. Ho had become enpw-blind. The, only thing wae to give his horse the bit. The horse stood stock stili, and by that he knew that ho had lest the trail altogether, for the bronche w9uld have followod any visible path. He wheeled tho horse about. It stili refused te go on; and then tho man in- ferred that the crust lôf ice had been se hard that the houe could .not follow back the way it had corne. That night thç trooper slept under the saddlo bi3nkets, with the faithful herse stand- ing sentry. For five days the policeman wandered blindly ever the prairie losing ail count ef time, eating snew te queuch his thirst, and sleeping lu the holes that the bronche had pawed through the ice- crust te the undergrass. Tho treoper wvas new tee weak te mount and koep the saddle. As a last hope the thought struck hlm that if bo unsaddled his horse and turned it loose it might find its way back te the fort and se notif y his friends that ho was loit. Ho did this, but the faithful creature refused te blave the man lying on the snew, and stood ever him lu epito of al his efforts to drive it off. The pathetic scene eu- acteI between these two, the blind and half-dead man and the affectionate herse, well able te look after itself, eau btter be imagined than deecribed. On the sixth day the mail-carrier found the pair. The trooper wae severely frezen, but rider and herse lived te seo many another day's service. Dealing with IndianCriminals lui the early days of the Mounted ,Police the prison where criminals f rom the Territories were conkned vas at Winnipeg, 2,000 miles by pýick trail fromt the outermost police poât. To have kept a horse thief at the ecene of his action in a reserve of several hundred Indians, with eniy a defence of twenty or thirty policemen, would have invited disaster. In one case, scouts disceverod that tii. Blackfeet were planning te rescue their bravo as ho was being drivn \u0026cross the plaine.. 4 detachrnent 61 police rode away eaut without the' prisener. Qpietly another detachment left at night and also rode away te the east. -Finally a third detachinent with the prisener slipped eut fromn Fort Mac- leod at midnight. The first two coin- panies had spread themaelves eut lu a patrol with relaya, ef f ree 'h herses for the entire, diutae-betweeu 'Fr, ac-- leod and Fort Walsh, which waa the next easteru fort, ouly stoppiug lon~g onough te hitch fresh teams to the wagons, the escort had daohed acrosa two hundred miles te Fort Walsh befere the Blackfeet knew that tîjeir warrior had been carried off. The. Police in War By 1882 the Mounted Police *,had b.- come rosponsible for the lives of the peeple of the entire. West, and for property scattered over 1375,000 square miles. Tradiug posts wer\"0eveloping iute towns, and cattiemen were bringiug large herdo inte tho country. At this turne it became necessary te increase the force te 500 mon. Permanent head- quarters wero established at Regia, substantial barracks instead of the log cabins aud stockadds which existed at. ether poste, beiug erected. In 1885, the Riel rebeflion gave the police plenty of werk, twelve men being killed and an equai number wounded la the first engagement with the robels at Duck Lake. A f 0w years after the rebellion the force was increased to 1,100 mou, the maximum strength te whioh it has ever attained. One of the greàtest achievements of the force was their persuading Sitting Bull and his six thousaud Sioux te re- turu and surrender te the United States autherities, after the massacre of General Custer and his troope, even wheu commissionors frem the United States had failed ln aoempliuhiug this. Police Duties are Being Extended The duties of the police are being ex- tended farther aud farther. Ferts are establishied lu the' farthest north, nome isolated, such as Fort Churchill on Hud- son's Bay, which is 700 miles frein anyý other trading post. Othèe are cloner together, as ou the trail frein White Herse te Dawsou, whore they are only twenty miles apart. A Police report recently recoived at Ottawa frein Herischell Island, in the Aretie Ocean, wae conveyod 1,000 miles by dog sleigh, 1,Q00 miles by water, and 3,000 miles by rail It teok over three menthe te mako the jeurnoy. As soon as the rush bogan te the Klon- dyke gold fields, a treop of police was sent up te the Yukon te maintain order. The cosmopolitan population of the rining towns marvelled at the adequacy of the force, as new settîcrs in western Canada do yet. Boundary patrele are still maiutaiued te intercept the horse thief Who drives a ranch band\u003eacroEss the lino te be quickly eold. Ou the boundary patrol, the Police travel aunually . more than a million miles. The \"rustler\"- who appropriates unbrauded animais for hie own herds, musit aise ho watched, traced, and punished. Prairie fires that might sweop awvay the year's feed. for the cattle and herses3, must be guarded and checked.

Even now there ils opportunity for the dieplay of those qualîties of fortitude and bravery which has made the naine \"Meunted Police\" famous throughout the world. One notable instance is the ride of Sergeant Tueker for sixty miles at a temperature away below zero te capture the murderer of Tucker Peach. The \"Riders of the Plains,\" in their mid- winter patrols, frequontly have to face the blizzards and Arctie colde that some- times sweep upon Alberta from the north.

There M spoke wvere ov'er forty of the family présent, ne buai- and an of themi were getting on in ths world. Everyone was in evening dress, and smre of the ladies wore\u003e diamonde, and Uncle Peter had a new service of electro-plate. ReaIly the dinner table looked very handsome. .And then Uncle Roberts came sliding ini just as shy as ever. He liati not even badl the deliey te borrow a drees suit; lie wore his old sbabby froek.- coat buttonied tight and the old satin stock that everybody knew so well. He we nt upý timidly to Uncle Peter Harri- son anf shoôk bande with hiin, wishinig hlm a \"Merry Christmas,\" and tlien looked round abeepishly at the other members of his family. ýZobody else of- fered to shake bande with hirn. Most of the ladies sniggered, and the men gazed the other way or t*lked polities. So Uncle Roberts sigbed, rubbed bis thun hands together, and crept down the rooma to take his aeeustomed place at the foot of the table. Uncle Peter, looking very handeoine and very well-to-db, said if everyone was ready hoe would have the aoup brought in. So aIl settled down, ring-a. ding went the bell, and ln came the soup in a glorious new plated tureen. Every- body could eeç\"he Harrisons were pros- perous, and so ail the rest of the family reflected the glow of their riches. Then suddenly the sharp voie of Aunt Matilda startled the whole party. \"M3y dear man,\" it was saying, «do ait up. Such behaviour you know-!\" When the others looked. they sbared ber just indignation. For that wretched creature, Uncle Roberts, was huddled up al lu a heap, and wae lyinR, forward on the table actually into his empty plate. Some of the gueste tittered, smre of the men looked knowing. The gaiety of the season had evidently got hold of Uncle Roberts. \"Perhaps he'e intoxicated,\" suggsted young Hopkins Harrison, wbo ie in a good position in a bank. Tt was a bold thing to say, but it certainly voiced the general opinion. \"Give him a shake. somebody,\" said Unele Peter. \"I've never seen bim like that before.\" No, hie neyer bad. For old Rupert Roberta, wbo je a dis- penser to the local doctor, having laid bis liand on the sboiuîder of the poor elerk and looked upon bis face said, \"He'e dead! \" Uncle Roberts was dead. The poor, old clerk wae dead. The poor relation, who bad attended the annual gathering of the family for goodness knows how many years, would attend no more. He liad neyer been invited, neyer been ,wanted - and bie would neyer intrude aga in. But it was just like him to die at sueh a moment. it was jiust the idiotie unfeeling thing bie would do. \"Take away the soup, James,\" said Uncle Peter te the servant, '«and tell the cook to keep it bot. Then corne back with smre of the other servants and carry the poor old gentleman into the attic, and perhape after that you bad better send for a doctor ,and the police. Ladies and gentlemen,\"\" bie went on, ad- dlressing the. fainily. «we will adjourn to the dlrawing rooni. Dinner muet be postlpone(I for a quarter of an hour.\" In tle drawing rooni Uncle Howard rainte forward with a brilliant sugges- tion to pass away the time. He said that, after aIl, the poor oid cbap was a member of the family, tbough a distant one. Perhaps it was flot bis fault that his state was so lowly; perbape bie wae î.ot to bMamne because his talents bad not raised hlimy to the hieiglits of esse and opu1lee enjoyed bh- somie who were lere 1wesent; but it w-as not for thema to be bard on iiiinoit that atrecting J;- April;",

A girl in an office should diseuss oniy things pertaining to the work of lier position. Many girls do not know their place.

Their letters wore fuîl of good suggestions. lt ta especially, gratifying t6 knôw that tihey encourage bigh ide-aie to be plaeed bof ore our girls. Some- times I feel that I may dwell too mucli on The Ideal in a girl's life. Then when letters, corne to me from young men urging me to continue painting the ideal I realize that our Young men want dlean girls. «Who ows in woakness connt rep lu 9trength- That which wo plant ve gather in at One young man states in hie letter to me: \"If e. \u003crl does not know rigbt from wrong before marriage she will nover know after.

And besides, girls, you are ail searching for happiness. Low ideals nover réach hap- piness. A 'happy, mind is a elean mid. The essence of happines ig honesty, sincerity and trutbfulnesq. I do not like te, hear girls talk about themselves. Ida M. Tarboil in ber book-\"The Busi- ness of Being a Woman\" says: Chronie self-discussion croatesl ferment of the mind-it is a serions handicap te both happinoas and effliency!\" The - mosb conspicuous occupation of woman to- dey is self -diiecussion.

No girl ean be happy wlho hs a narrow, uncharitable disposition. A girl wbo deceivos a young man is a thief of the worst type, ho- cause site is sqteaiing a humnan heart to tbrow away in a sorely bruisedj condi- tion. Site not only crualhes tbe young man but she is a traitor to ber \"ex because ho judges other numen by ber.

If Yoù are either 'toiàll \" or piiaUly deaf, or troiibled *.ith-rmg Ig, orý buzziîng noisesi the head, you knowý quite well the humiliation and terrible suffering that they cause. There is, however, no longer any reason to be troubled with these conditions, as they can now be quck- ly and positively overcome by a reffiarkable new discovery. This discovery, since it was brought to light a littie over a year ago, has effected some of the most wonderful cures ever known, and in subjecting it to various tests in the worst known cases of deafness and head noises, the most miraculous results have been obtained. Here is a testimonial selected ut random frorn the hundreds coming to band every week. It was written by Mr. Win. Kerr, Box 453, Henryetta, Okia, U.S.A.: \"I arn 55 years of ag, and for 32 years had suffered from deafn;ess and distressing head noises. The 'Shirle Systemn' treat- 'ment, bowever, has worked wonders in my F'o caecompletely curing my terrible affliction. orerly I could not hèar my watch tick, even when pressed close to the ear,. but in ten days 1 could hear it a good distance off. A few days later the head noises all passed away and I could then hear as well as ever I could in ny life.\" Suçfstrong faith bas the Discoverer in this new treatment as a positive cure for deafness and head noises, that bee has decided to niake the following remarkable offer: He will for- feit the sum o9f $500 if hie fails to prove that bis treatment actualy cures deafness and head noises; hie will forfeit $500 if anyone can prove that lie was flot the actual discoverer of this wonderful treatment; be will forfeit $500i if every testimonial and sworn statement mllich he publishes is not absolutely genuine. SO otoundingly successful bas this treatment [tr(-d in the worst fornis of chronic deafness, 1!noises, etc., that the Discoverer will, glodl1y send a free trial to any sufferer who n)( ntions this paper and encloses 5 cents to cOer postage.

The light of the engine was aiready distant. Moore feit that his sfiout had not been understood. The engine would net have been of use even had it caught up with him now; it would havt been impossible to have gtopped the derrick car at the speed At had attained. The derrick alene weighed two tons; and irristible gravity was hurrying every pound of it faster and faster down the hill. Through Moore's mimd there raced a confusion of thoughts, that swept on with speed greater than that of the car. \u0026on the massive derrick would eM~h into the wreck.

Her respectJ for authority was phenomenal, thougli - uvn ntseventeen.it by no meails lm- piied that she approved, or reepected the trson holding authority. Slle seemed bthink she was there to leara lessons ndobey rules, a view that wvas not iralnt among us; and'I must admit Itebsehetas a sbining success in both respects. Yet I rememiber wondering, once or twice,' what wouid happen if Sylvia ever had cause given hier to cesse regarding obedienoe as a virtue. If mother badn't decided, eariy one spring, some seven years after our sehool days were over, that I was out of heaith and in need of reet, I miglit bave been *wondering yet. 'Sylvia,- hearing of rny alleged ill-health, wrote asking me to spend a few weeke of iuy enforced leisure with bier. 1 knew that I shouid enjoy myseif, so 1 went. Sylvia was housekeeper in her father's home, the only other member of tbe family, besides lier father, being an invalid aunt. And Sylvia's bouse was exquisiteiy orderiy, though the young mistress' authorîty was by no means supreme, lier father being the liead of the bouse in a inost literai sense. I neyer knew wbat Sylvia thouglit of this etty autocraey, thougli I bave too ~eat a respect for hier intelligence to suppose sbe saw much wisdomn in it. $lie was evidentiy very fond of bier father, and.she w'as most scrupulously observant of al bis wisbes. But 1 had not been ldng witb bier before I saw that there was a difference of opinion on one particular point, be- tween bier and bier father, of recent beginning, but surprisingily weil-defined. I feit certain that tiiere neyer was an uncivil word between them; the oid gentleman would bave forgiven mean- ness sooner than inciviity, and Sylvia would neyer have forgotten either. Yet the fact of tbeir difference was ap- parent, even before 1 hadl any idea of its ground. I learned that the firet evening they were \"at homne\" after my arrivai. Syl- via's aunt, whose invalidism was of that obliging sort that interferes only with usefulîiess, not with pleasure, used to put on a silk gown and corne downstairs oit titese occasions, and we really hall better times tlîan you wouid think. It was the irat of these evenings that I saw the cause of Sylvia's disagree- nment with lier fatber, and it was nearly six feet bigli and quite fiee to look ait, andl went by thé naine of Ernbridge. 1 liati a few minutes' conversation with Mr. Ernbridge that nighit, and I oblig- ingly spent the time in amiable ebatter aboit soinething ho didi't need to pay mnuch attention to, so that lie miglit wateli Sylvia. Withliber bie bad little chiance to sîeak, bier bospitable duties, wlîielîI 1could see Miss IHarcourt vas piIosely making onerous for bier, pre- ventilng. But when hie said \"Goodnigt\" chance gave lim, a half-minute's isolation aniong thé departing guests, anti after that I could have told xny wortliv host to save ]lis energy for soînle otlier dispute; bis daugliter wasn't trifliiitr Tllere wvas among the guests that iiiglit a youing gentleman called Martin, oie 0f 'flue most rising yotung nuen tliat ever rose.

Between them, Sylvia. was seldom aliowéd to have flve minutes', speech with Mr. Ernbridge, either alone or in Company. But 9S'ivia andý lue ad -prob- ably reached anu uderstanding morne time earlier, befor e the watch-dogs bad w9ke\u003cI up. Mr. Ernbridge muat'aleo have attained his position as a familier, guest (and it was easy to fancy ove» -Misas HarcourV's.- iking him unbidden)- before Mr. Harcourts opposition was aroused. Sueh favour it was quite li. possible to witbdraw from bim now without good reason, and as he had 33 not yet formally spoken to Sylvia's fath- er, no such reason was lorthcoining, and hé stood bis ground witb that ad- mirable tenacity that sonîctimes acent- plishes itw object, and is always a please- ure to contemplate. Sylvia'a communications were meagre, but 1 gatheréd from the littie she said that~ her father's opposition was grow- ing stronger. She seemed unaware that this was owing to Mr. Martin'a more frequent visita, and 1 didn't en- iïghten lie,for-that sort oL-ambi\",o is ilot a lovely quality' to contemplato in one's father. But if she had desired, to eultivat Mr. Martin's àoquaintance, her seniors wou1d have given her plenty The Western, Home Mon thly will, 50 I1 ent, i and sat on, the foot of lier bcd, while sbe brushèd ber hair, and, because notbing else came into My mmnd tîjat 1 could say, 1 repeated scraps of Mr.,'Martin's witty- conversation--to anmuse lier. Slie laughed appreciatively once or twice, but at last abe said quaintly: 1 \"Do vou know. 1 think common sense is nîucb nicer than thatV\" \"Oh, for cveryday use, of course it is,\" 1 adritted. \"INo, I1nican for ail conversation. Simple language seems wiser to me. But I know Mr. Martin bas common sense, too, only it's not a lovable kiiid.\" As I had not heard of tlis kind before I ýsaid nothing, tlîinking tlîat I miglit learn more about it wben I1lied another opportunity for observing Mr. Eru- bridge's character. Sylvia turned from ber mirror pres- ently, and began an allegory, without preface. \"Once upon a time- there was an imprisoned princess wlio desired lier liberty, and sIc had only hier bodkin. But she dug out some of the stones in lier prison wail with the bodkin, and made a. long rope of tbe window cuir- tains and hangings, and jet berseif down to tbe ground.

But I'm 1 not sure that hoe noticed bier silence; hoe stood talking easily, telling us that to-1 norrow was Easter Friday, and recaîl-j ig a number of Easter practices and1 superstitions, until he was interrupted1 by the \"good-niglits\" of the hast guests.1 I hail no chance for further talk wvith Sylva that niglit, deselle went immed- itely to help Miss Harcourt, whom the yven ing hadl fatigued somewhat. The next morning as I passedl Syl- Via's door on nîy way downstairs, I knocked softly, thinking she might biea ater than usual after the party, but I t rceived no answor.

But 1 was credibly though ebliqueiy informed later that ne wedding is ionely, provided the brid7egroom la there.

It was the most gen- ulue expression I had ever seen on bis face, except for those firat unguarded moments that morning after hie had opened SyIvia's note, and I for'got the Judirous side of the matter, in pity for Sylvia and for him.

A preacher sbould b. looked upon primarily as a minister, niinister- ilîg ta every need af the community. Iu no sense does this minimize bis pulpit utterances; but the \"personal toucli\" is being found ta bie the outstanding force in the work of our country districts. A churcli in a small town i Soutbern Michigan may bie mcntioned as an ex- ample of the effectiveness of tliorough- going leadership. Four years ago this church and society were ncarly extinct. The minister's saiary vas $400 a year, with a smali brokcn-down bouse throwîi in. Ta-day the cburcli building bas been enlarged and thoroughly renovated, the salary is $1,200 and the membersbip bas been trebied. The youug man who vas engagcd ta take up work in this im- portant yet greatly weakened field set at bis task by spending ane wliole year in educating bis scattered farces to be- lieve in extcnded work, Rie advocated reaching out everyWhere and interesting every famiiy in the neighborhaod in soins kind of useful work that could bie undertaken every day i the week. Af ter the firat year lie vas abl. te do some very definite things that made tb. church indispensable ta the if e of the community. -_An orchestra vas organized among the. young people. Thougli practîce was neyer beid in the elîurch building, and the orchestra oniy occasionally played there, nevcrtheiess the cburch reudered a substantial service as the prômoter cf the musical 1f e of the people. Incident- ally, nxany young persoa who wcre previously uuaffiliated vitb the chureb became faithful attendants at its services. A young men's club vas organ- ized. Strong speakers were. secured f rom a near-by city-men vho vere interested voung mnen. This club did not confine itself ta ciasa or creed, but stood as an organizatiami open ta evcry young mian of the neigbborhoad. Many young mien became associated with the churel because of the work of this club. The extension course of the state universityr was secured for the community, whercby lectures on agriculture, forestry, hiatory and travel vere given ta the fariner@ wvith littie or na charge. In many other places debate clubs, Bible-study an# Mission-study- classes, Boy S cou t brigades and similar organizations have been successfuliy used ta promate a widespread commuity vork. The country work department of the Young Men's Christian Association is a pioncer in the field of volunteer work- inanslîip. Its tbeory for rural work la very little equipment, except lu bramas, energy and religious devotian. Every nman and boy wbomn the association reaches is cncauraged to became a \"ýservant of the people?\" This principle lias proved very effective as a stimulus for the association and bas certainiy made possible an extended work amonge the people. It bas been proved a mistakte -te. \"bhiteli \" permanently a country church or achool-house, where service is held on Sunday, ta a town cburch. In aimost every case vhere this plan bas been followed the country, vork bas failed. Because the town minister is not allowed ta spend much time, looking after the \"cout-appointment,\" and because nothing is ever attempted except thie Suinday service, no appealiiig prografi 15 put before the people.

Just what is the mattor? Don't the other girls like ber?\" \"Yes, and tlîat's just w}îat 1 don't un- derstand. Thoy're ustially se exacting yet 1 neyer saw any one se quickly popular as Margaret. But she makes ne distinctions; she'll spoak te any one. Why, titis afterîioon, on our way to the mîatinoe, s helped sorne old womain with lier bundles, found lier a seat in, the car, and tlien, I firmly believe, lis- tened te the whole family history. It was just the saine way when she huitted the city bialf over to flnd the address that istupid Swede wanted. She nearly made us late for the concert, and The Rogers\" - Emily spoke the namo in lîuslîed Roman capitals-\"v'ere with us. They were amused, but tlien, she's net tlieir cousin.\" «You rmust remember,\" said Mrs. Phelps, gravely, -that Margaret was the minister',s daugbiter in a littie coun- try town, and tlîat it's always been ber privilege to know every one, to speak te anybody, and te lîelp in ail ways.\" \"Oh, that's al very well for a littie village like Neeleton, but in a big city site ouglît te understand the difference,\" answered Emily. \"If she does anything gauehe when we go te see Fiera Barksr to-morrow-well, sIte can just go alone after that,\" aînd the girl walked eut of tihe roorn with lier wraps and ber grievance. But at dusk the inext afternoon a dif- ferent Emily came inte the room. She was laugiîing a littie, yet someisow her wbole maniner was softened and a littie apologetic.- \"Ima cbastened spirit,\" she an- nouniced. l'il tel youlAUabout it, offly don't laugh at me, pleape, and don't think me snobbisiî. We went, yen know.- and wben we got there the hall. was cram-jaxu full; net a seat-to be had, just standing-room. And after we'd acram'- bled for places, the first thing Margaret did was te push me in front of ber. \"'You're suds a iittle thing, «Emily,' she said, 'that I cani see riglît over your liead.' Thon sé actually took off her own bat because she was sure site was too tal with it on. Informai? Oh, yos, but abe was se jolly and brigbt and in- spiring that I couidn't feel cross or dig- nified; and at lat one of the women we'd been talking to-yes, we did, andl 1 didn't know them, eitiîer, and inmnet a bit asbamed-said te her, 'My dear, if * von weren't hiere te alleviate the suifer- ing of mùY peor, tired knees I simply couldn't stay.' \"Then at the intermission what do you think bappened?

Western Canada', Great Seed ITouse are Agents t or ___________RT0 I L THE missionary soeety was an inno- vation in thle Prairie Corners _ church.m- -Even the neiv minister,- with al his energy and advanced meth- ods of work, hardly believed it advis- able. But the minister's wife persisted. She liad shown herself wise in lier genera- tion by forming a young people's soci- etv. The meetings, somnev at of a soeial nature, were lield in the evening; and young nmen were even more heart- ily'-welcomed than their sisters, for the î-ouths of Prairie Corners wvere not in- -tensely interested in chiurcli affairs. Indeed, an age qualification for ac- tivîty in this line liad become so fixed that even regular attendance at churchi for a boy between the ages of sixteen and twenty, in the eves f his 'fellows presaged calam itv-tûe breaking down of bealtb, or perhiaps an .early death. There were other attractions outside of the church wlere the age line was not se clearly defined, and there were some homes wliere at family prayers the petitions for the vouth brouglit a quiver to the voice. Vius, wlien the missionarv meetings fiourished under efficient leadership, and grew popular bevond belief and to the exclusion of p]eerures lessa wlîolezome, the minister's wife and lier undertaking received the indorsement and hearty ývpport of the older gfflration of Prairie Corners. It was in the autumn, when the mis- sionary soiety ivaa approaching its first birthday, that the question of a missionary box began to be discussed. The minister's wife hiad a judicious way of introducinie such matters. -~ - ~ a t ,,. The brteakfast -table at Farmer 'Rigg's was fairly'rer1reseatati'.e of a score of others the- next moraing \u0026after, the de- cision te pack a missionary box liad. been made. 'As one's sympathy is nat- urally directed toward those differing in condition, it was not strange that a home missionary family in a Nortiiern, logging town Iîad been chosen to lie the recipient of Plairieî Corners' generosity. \"ÉDe you suppose, mnother,\" asked 'Dora, \"1that we havé anything, good to send ?» Mrs. Riggs, divided in attention lie. tween the pouring of coffee and thq baby's demandg for more sugar on his oatmeal,-,j-ised perplexed evel)rows. ,I arn sure 1 couldn'! tell, dear.

         "Winnipg, April, 1914. The -Western Home - Monthly I WoodWorkers In tho -big luniber-milis of AmeýiCa they think nothing of reducing great pine sticks to kid ngwood in a few mninutes, and tho miliman is merely re- quired to osoe -tht tho atick is socnred straight ini the carrnage. euch a man, gays a. Iwiter. iii Evoryb6dy's Magazine, would be. bewildered if compelled éud- denly to follow the Phillippine method of hiumbr-reduetion.--Thero the largest eticks are sawed by hand. Even woeds as bard as teak are set up on a frame, and two laborers mono- tonously pull a big saw through its tough length for days and days, until they have-' produced the slahs cf which Easterfl furniture is made. Yet, in spite ocf the length of time necssary te achieve such a resuit, these woods are exported teocivilized countrles at good profit. 1 After the lumber is eut into compara- tively smail pioces, it is sold te the native carpenters and builders te b. erected into bouses. MU the native car- penter has a itask before him that cails for the exorcise of greater akili than is required cf his fellow craftsman in Canada. The modern carpenter is littie more -than a-joiner cf -parts The ine-- tricate moldinga and beadinge used in our housos are made in mills by mach- inery, and qorne ready finishod te the joiner's hand. Ail ho bas to do is to put them together. The carpenter cf the far East receives the wood in the rougi, exactly as it is left by the sawyer. Ho, or a fellow tradesman, must carve his moldings ho- fore they eau be placed in thoe'houses.- In India, China, Turkey, Syria and' ad- jacent countries tiese lever artisans may bc seen working with tools as primitive almost es those used ithe days before America was discovered. Oc-' casionally' an eflterprising native will int.roduce a smali piece èf Western- made machinery, but not often. L\u0026thes are everywI4ere employod, but they are not_ the--steel article exported-from tie United States. The wood to be turned in secured in a spindie; a cord attached te a flexible stick is given'a turn or two round it; the other end of the cord is drawu taut, and the resulting bow ie worked backward and forward. The. effeet of this is te whirl the wood rapidly, when it may ho easily shaped by means of kuives and chisels. Aft W, Doing God'a Will? Henr Drummond asked this question long ago, but it in as pertinent, as evor. \"cAre' we doing Godes wîll ?» He says, 111 do not mean, Are we doing God'a work? -praching, or teaching,. or collocting mÉoney-buit'God's wili. A mani may think he is doing (jod's work when ho is'nQt even doing God's will.' And a man may ho doing Gçod's work and Ged' wil quite- air much by -hewing itoffes ý t sweeping streets, as bY preaching ot' praying. So the question means juatI this: -Ire we, working eut our eoniuion every-day life on the great linos -of God's wifl?\" There is a world of differpnco betweea the rule of gold and the golden rule",

Lloyd was on a tour of exploration in Central Africa he met with many interesting àdv'entures, whieh he has noted in his book off travels, \"In Dwarf Land.\" The conver- sion of a noterious desperado is thus graphically deacribed: Soon after 1 got te TJganda, whule talking te thc crowd, I noticed a strange fellow standing outside. He was tail, with very long hair, quite unlike the ordinary Uganda. man. In lais hand he held a hu,, ) spear with a blade two and a-hait feet in length, and five inches widc in the centre.

Prevention of Pneumoio niaj Ptheurnonià was, for nome -reasan \\,Or' other, epecialy prevalent and especially m!aligqnant -Ilut winter and spring; wheter it will b. se again this seaws o anc can tell. It flot irnprobably wiul de- ,pend a good deal upon the weatlier. If it in coid. and starmy, so that people keep their windows shut tight and con- fine thernseivom in stuffy and unventi- iated roarna, there will doubtiess be a great deal of pneumonia. The poison of pneumonis in givea off in the moisture of the breath, and especially in the matter coughed up from the bronchial tubes; conaequently great care should be taken ta dostroy auelh matter before it has a chance ta dry and be spread about with the duat. Pa per handkoîchiefs, whieh ean bo burned at once, should be used, or special re- ceptacles for sputum, sucli as are ad- vised in the case of the consumptive. As the chiof danger lies i the con- centratiôn of the poison, spocial care should bc taken ta ventilate the sick- roarn. For this puipose nothing is btter than an open fic, the heat of which draws the miciobe-ladon atrnosphere up the chirnney, and at the arne thne purifies it. Many cames of pneumonie are eaught i churces, theaters, cars and et er places wliere cuowda collet and the ventilation je not of the bet; and it la a wlse- precaution for ail wlia are flot in p'hyica1 cndition or are tempor- dsed leprbsdy or mind ta keep away from ucl plaesof assembly. The inla.aother elernent in the pro- duction cf pneumonie besides the germ, as is made evident by the fact that ail persoa at nmre time or another, and smre persoa nearly ail the tirne, barbor the microbe of pneumonie In their bodies. This element la the natural re- sistance of the individual. The tissues of a liealthy mn do not furniali a fertile mil for the guawth and multiplication of the pneumonie microbe. It je oniy when there je an invasion by a hast of germe, which by sheer numbers overcome the re- sisting power of the attacked, or when the systeni in depuessed and normal re- sistance weakened, that pneumnonie de- velops. To keep the body in a condition to a int invasion, plenty cf pure air, pure water, temperance ioating and dîinking, a cheecu aind, exorcises for the lunge and muscles, and all those aids ta heaith so frequentiy epoken of ini these articles aie essential. They are the sureet means ta prevent pneumonia. CoUd Bathinë The application of cold ta the surface of the body by means of the bath is a pawerful agent, the value of which in'the treatment of disease as weil as in the preservation cf liealth la being increas- ingly realized. The action of a cold bath froni fifty ta ixty degrees) is stimulating and tonie. It acta powerf*4y upon the neuvous system, making the neuves more prompt in their rospanse ta the needs of the organism, and freshens the mental faculties ta a wanderfui degree. It banishes- the duil and listless feeling which anc who je not in the robust health of youth is go apt tao xperience an first getting out cf bed. It exorcises and strengthens, also, the muscular walls of the arteries, upon the normal action of which the praper distribution cf the blood throughout the body in gpont mensure depende. The flrst contact of the cold water with the body causes a sharp contraction of the blood-vessels cf the ekin, as shown by the palIer of the surface; but as soon as anc beaves the bath the arteries dilate, tuie skin becorues pink, and a warm glow is felt that amply compensates ane for the disagreoable shock of the firet plutigo. This flushing cf the surface, which brings with it warmth and a sensation of vigor and well-being, is the test which shows that the batîh is doing good. If this renctiosi dot-sint ost-. îl one feela cold and depresst-d, aid the lakisi rernains of a blulali hue, it is a sign that the bath ie harniful, and thenl one must be content with a cool spouging, followed by a briek rub with a coarse towel.

The Baby'.Flrst Danger When a child first cornes into, the world it9 hold upon Ife is very slight and may be, and often is, broken by any one of several possible accidents.- Fortu- nately, nature tries to takè'care of and strengthen thia feble grasp of existence Life at flrst depends mnainly enf the i1h~medate establishment of th4 breath- ing procesa. Thé flrst impulse of nome babies, born pessimiste, seema te be te- ward a determined attempt, at suicide. The hold the breath until they are bZc in the face, and have te be quit. seriously disciplined te bring them te their littie senses. Generally, however,i nature does not require any assistance i these matters. She simply impresses upon the lîttie citizen a realizing sensej of ail that is before him in Ibis vale1 cf teas, and the foretaste in toc, muchi for him. Re bursis forth ini a lusty yell,1 and then he cannot help taking deep1 breaths, even if he would.

This is why that lirsî feeble squalling is sa welcome a seund, fer il means tiat baby is fully alive and asserting itself. If this crying is nal pramptly heard, il is safe te assume that samething is wrang, and the baby must b. loakcd ta. If it is lying metionlesa, and evidently tee feeble te bear a gentie shake or a spat, the beat thing te do is ta lake a hint from nature and stimulate the nerves of the skia. This can be dane in several ways. One good plan is ta rub the surface af the body with a little brandy poured into the palma of the banda. If this fails, alter- nate applications cf heat and cald ta the skia will sametimes excite lie needed gasping. This is donc by having one basin full of warm (of course flot o hat) and another of cald water, and plunging the baby fîrat imb the warm water for a moment, and then int the cold. This may b. repcated if necessary. Liing the Simple ILite The trend of life ini this age is ta- ward complexity. M'ith the world's de- teloping resaurces there bas corne a corresponding increase in desires and appetites, reaching far bevond that which is essential for man's best health and wvell being, into the realrn of Inere sense gratification. As a result, civilized people have, as races, greatly deterior- ated and as individuals largely failed of fulfllling the bighest human destinv. Iiistead of the betternient of humýan. ity and the progress. in hiappiness, health. mness, and virtuousness, which 4in ight be supposed should reauit fromi the added fail te ber share, and the more meagre the. allotmnent cf time and strength at hier command for hier own progreaand culture. Innumerable women there are whose lives are literaily biuried beneatii social and domestie burdens, the. haif cf which are really non-essenlials, the results cf our campiez system of living. As another has aptly said, «W. are fritting away our lives on things whie thoughts gelt tc go-by. We are bond- slaves te conveniences and serfs te luxuries. We spcnd s0 much lime and energy getting the material aide te en- joyment falsely though neeessary, that we leave neither lime nor strength for the enjoyment itsecf.

Rock CiaO, on Planning Farm Homes The importance te the fariner cf bav- iîg an ecenomical farm bliuse bas been eunphasized by the farin architect cf the Department cf Agriculture, whe sMates tîtat the mental and pbysicaj fitîs cf the laborers both within the bouse and in the fields are vitally affected by the building that afferds the famiiy shelter. The average Ameriean fari borne bas failed to share in the improvements that are every day being made in agricultural conditionsý and, according te the architeet, is a rebuke to our boasted civilization. Relatively, lie says, tbe house.vife of a century ago, with lier fire-place cooking and log cabirn, vas better provided for than is the bouse- vife to-day. The most important building on a farin ia the borne. The bealth, comfert, and happiness cf the family are depen- dent upea its construction aid equip- ment, and unless these matters are looked after the sanitary dairy barn or tho economically coîstructed buildings for stock are of little value. Happines and contentaient in the family are as essential te efficient service as improved tools and outhuildings. Although- the housewife speîds, in manyý cases, a lifetire ne lier \"work- shp\"thé kitchen and famidy rooma, she is net, as a rule, capable cf planning a bouse in thc bigbest degrcc serviceable and comfortable vithout assistance. Her help, however, is- essential te bhc farin arc htect, as the result of bis plais moat vitally concernaslber. One cf the most important details re- Zarihdnz flii av'raitc Anicriean farm bouse is that' it must Ve inexpeusive. The average annual net income of a fariner tok-day, after deducting five per cent interest on his irives tient, 'i5 les thaaj $400. This does not mean that the bouses may not b. attraetive. They rnay, if intelligently planned with the help of vines, shrubs, and trees, become the prettiest spots in the landacape, and more beautiful and inexpensive than the crowded city'bouses. Certain features are often overlooked in providing economical arrangements for the housebold wheî they miht be easily provided for. Oieofthe specialias of the office of Farin Man- agement Iearned froin a oeinin Pensylvania, wbo had breken ddwn froin overwork, that she bad been carry. ing coal frein the barn for years. When the huaband was asked if there vas any reason why a coal bunker could net have been provided near the cook stove and filled directly frein the wagon, be answered thst there vas none, buit that no one bad ever thought of it. This one detail ýas been found neglected lu other cases where it coud have been easily rernedied, if only someone had thouglit of it. .\u0026fter econeiny in thec construction of the building and in thebouse werk bas U.'. Ry. been attained, attention wiii bc given te developing beauty. Simplicity inlu le aid geed proportions are meant by the use cf Ibis word beauty, and net se- cailed applied \"ornaments.\" This sim- plicity is entirely in keeping with a general plan cf economy. Economy, bQwever, is net a synonym for ceheapnese. Double strenRth glass may even be more econemical iu a ten- ant bouse than single strcngtb, notwith- standing its greater first ceaI. A kitchen siîk may be a paying investinent, a]- though it exeludes a bay window, or a fireplace, whicb bas been the pet notion cf the bousewife. Screened-in kitelien porches, sleeping porches, deuble or tri- ple windows and kitchen cenveniences are fine economical features which even the amallest bouse plans may weil con- sider. Separate- dining ronm-s for families that qenerally eat in the kïtchen are leas important, as are \"par- lers.\"' These separate reoins may have complete systems cf plumbiîg, beating and lightinjr which involve additionai ex- pense.

Unquestionab1i the president and the secretary ýo agriculture bave the gondoff the. Ameri cari fariner at hearL - The most vital subject perhaps in cor nection with the work of the depari. ment bas been with regard te rural eredit and the better facilities for mar. keting the farm. crop, The Secretary of Agriculture bas said, 'We sha learcav notbing undone to stimulate production direetly and toeocnvey information tu the fariner, but wc bave suddenly been brought face te face with the fact that in many directions further increased production waits on better distribution. It secins that the keynote of the en- tire policy 1i'i the management of the Departinent of Agriculture, is an ;in- provement of rural conditions ilirougi every possible means. The secretary ia not trying te add a busbel te the production of each acre berause of that bushel alone. V~e is striving te, inerease production and in- prove the conditions under which peo- ple live on the farins, of tbis country in order that it may b.e possible te use the increased profits for the develop- ment of a higber class of citizens. The Secretary of Agriculture and the President are united in one tbing and tha.t is that the fariner does net need any class legisiation. The. aecretury bumueif says, «One thing.is clear. The schemes that are mnultiplying whicb conceive the. fariner te bie a mendicant and a subject of unique and Ppecial legialation may b.e at once condemned. The American fariner does net need or desire te b.e classeki' with those foreign, people who are juat emene frein a condition of serfdom n uea ge. He asks ne opportunity that la not afforded te every-American citizen. Re meka for ne legislation which will give him credit on casier ternis than hbis brother meohanie or his professional friend or bis merchant mnay seeure it, but ho doca ask te b. assisted in creating con- ditions and machincry which shall en-' able hum on a similar credit foundation te, secure bis money at the saine rate as any other ciass in the community. This, and this alone it seenis te, nie is ail that 'lie asks and la nothing less than lie deserves. 1 amrnont mmprcsatd with the wiadom, the justice of proposais that wouid take the moncy of ail the people through bonds or other devices and ]end it to the farmers or to auy othier class at a rate of interest lower than the eeoneniie conditions wouid normally requiro and at a rate of interest iower titan that at which other classes are securing their capital This wouid bie special legîsiation of a particularly odious type and no new ex- cursions in this direction would bie palatable 'when we are cngaged in tihe gigantic task of restoring the simple rule of e(lulty.\"1 The above je the keynote of a sane, wiîse and liealthful solution of the credit proposition. The placing of fai mu credits on better and stronger founda- tion is going to mean much te the peo- 1pie of thi8 couuntry. In the field of marketing an equally wise poiicy je outlined. la faet, the above qiitation iil give one an idea of what the new Secretary of Agriculture believ'es in behiaif of the fariner anîd the agricultural conditions and the scolie of bis departnient in improvingj and stimulating a higber plane of ef- ficieîîey anîd liv'ing for the nien who are on the fanes of the United States.

University Experiment Station, issued a bulletin relative te the poasi- bilities of feeding early-hatcbed pullets during the summer by retarded or forced feeding, -eays \"Poultry Hus- bandry.\" By retarding is meaut the idea that feediug je necessary during the late summer te check the early teudeucy of laying, with the hope cf getting a larger egg yield lu the early winter. By frced feeding ia meant the giving of a rich, stimulating mash te induce egg production. Concerning the resuits cf bis work, NMr. Rie bas certain findings drawn front data wbich are submitted below: 1. Forced pullets made a better pro- fit than retarded puliets. 2. Forced pullets ate less food per ben at less cost per heu than retarded pullets. 3. Forced pullets produced more eggs of a larger size, at less cost per dozea thian retarded pullets. 4. Forced pullets produced more eggs diiring early winter than retarded pifflets. Wormns cause fretfulness and rob the infant of sleep, the great nourisher.

GettIng Rid of Poultry Lie Lice trouble bons, ducks, geese and tîrrkeys te a greator or less extent, aud lu warin weather they infest bous aud poultry bouses more than anythiug else. if ne measures are takon te dohck thent they may affect the egg yield and cer- tainly the comfort cf the - fowls. They live and multiply on the hieu or chick; lay their eggs ou the shaft of the feather and the eggs hatch front the heat cf the body of the bird. The only self-protec- tion that a hieu has front lice la through killiug thein by menus of dusting. The pores of the bouse, by menus of which it brenthea, muat be fillbed with duat te suffocate it before it eau bo killed. The flock sheuld be provided with duat boxes at ail times, winter and summer. The hieu works the fiue particles of duat in amongst 'ber feathers, and tbe line particles fil1 the opeuings cf the broath- iug tubes and the lice are killed. Witb a amaîl flock which are badly infested it le advisable te, dust the birds individu- alIy. Take tbe lben by bier legs, head dcwnwnrd, and dust a reliable brand cf juseet powder lu the feathers arcuud the veut, betweu the legs, under the wings and aloug the back. The powder should be worked into the feathors tberougbly, by rubliug witb the baud and the powder should rench the recta cf the feathers particularly. ,The peultry'bouse sbould be tbcrougb- ]y treated, disiufecting the entire bouge once or twice a year with acte good commercial disinfectaut. Iu tbe summer time the roesting quarters should le sprnyed or painted itbtedsnetu every week. Ths trentment js neces- sary te id the premises cf lice, as a great many cf them stay lu the bouse in the day time and attack the liens at nigbt. Ail cracks and crevices cof the roosting quanters abould be practically soaked. It ie aise a gccd plan te white- wsh the bouse once n year, usingé a 2 ýr cent solution cf carbolic acid lu the ,ùitewasb. ,Ail disinfecting should le thorougb and negulan and the' kens should le able always te dust themselvea freely.

An officiai summary of th. position furnishes aomo signi- ficant figures, which have a very direct interest to Australia and New Zealand. A s9tudy of the availabie figures viii prove two points, nameiy: (1) thoe t- le èf the worid areo n creasig at the marne rate as are the respective popula- tions, and (2) that in severai co the more.important countries 1h. dairy cat- le represent grater percentages of the total herds. Ine the foilowing. countries the numbers of cattle have decreased: United Kingdom, India, Hoiland, Nor- way, Bulgaria, Egypt, Austria-Hungary, United States, Argentins, Japan, Servia,1 Chili, and Natal. The following are Pasman, manager of the USasin.v\u0026 Company, the largest frue.mmut cou. corn la Argentin\u0026.

Ho thought it strange. our people did not know that American packers had for nmre time been operating in South America. Ho said il vas an open secret there that the Americans were shipping forty per cent of the Argentine frozen meut output. Ne fran2kiy admltted there had been an ««agreemnent\" among their meut freezers in regard te the «amounït of business,\" but il vas a thinj of the past, and he preferred not to dascuas it. uSince the 'dissolution' there bas been a pitched battie for freezer stock, and it vas freeiy admitted that freezer con- cerna have lost fromn 16 te 28 per cent en Where the 00w in of double serie sonie of thie*ast notable reductions:I thie United Kingdorn in 1880 there wer 294 cattie per 1,000 of the population- in 1011 Ibis had fallen to 261; in th Argentine Republie ini 1895 there wer 5,487 cattle for every 1,000 inhabitanti and in 1908 only 4,656. In the Unitei States in 1880 the cattie numbered 79 pet- 1,000 peuple, and in 191f2 only 61E In Austria-Hungary in 1880 there wer, M6 cattie per 1,000, and in 1910 oniy 31U On the other hand, the catle in Ans tralia, New Zealand, Denmark, Sweden Italy, Germany, Canada, Ru ssia, Franc and Transvaal have increased mor rapidly than the population, the follow ing heing the principal examples:\u003c i Germany in 1883 there were 329 cattli per 1,000 inhabitants, and in 1907 thii had risen to 331. In Italy -in 1882 theN were 167 per 1,000, and in 1908 Ibis had increased to 183. In France in 188, there were 347 cattie per 1,000, and hr 1911 Ibis had risen bo 367. In Australie in 1901 there were 2,279 caIlle per 1,000, and in 1010 there were 2,654. Tiiese increases, however, by no means compensate for the decreases wlich have taken place in other coun. tries, as the suni of the figures upon which caiculations have been based, ini the cases of those countries where de- creases are noted, is, appruximately 21,389,000, whereas in those countries wlîere increases have occurred the figures total only 102,654,000. This can hardly ho taken as a truce statistical comparison on accoiunt of the figures covering a range of some feu-t% vears ia each case, but they will gi-e 'a fairly accurate indication of the position. From the Australian and New Zea- ]and point of iew, Argentina is the niost important factor ini the worjds meat supply; that is. as the chiiefrcoin- petîtor for thie tracte. In this coanec- lion, an American journal just to baudl publishes an interview with Mr. Miles cattle during thie pasit season. Mr. Pasa eSYs the Argentine Republic may bave sevenîy or ninety million shee?,. that the figures published are oniy esti- mates. Hie tbinks the sheep stock will remain about the same---sys there is nu particular reason for a decline as a good many catîle men are quitting and going into sheep - his conceru among them, increasing Iheir own fiocka from thirty. to fifty thousand hcad. The southern country will continue bo raiso sheep in such large numbers that Nlr. Pasman thinka any loas in the 'farming sections' wiil be made up. We put- the plain question lu Mr. Pasman regarding control of the American frozen ment market by the Chicago packers, but he tvas very luth bt express an opinion,.fHe -did say, however, that the 'independent concerna' in the United States might have something b asay about the mar- ket. We bold him it vas pretty gener- ally understood Ibat the so-caiied 'beef trust' controlled the price of ment here, and Y that independenîs had littie tb say.\" Aye, Aye, Siri D)uring the bombardment of Alexan- dria, in 1882, Lord Charles Beresford as ked a gunner if he could bit a mani who wvas on the fort.
