Why H1e Got It By Bey. Wylie C. Clark, B.D. Two boys of seveateen were applying for the ramne position in a large business warehouse. They were to meet the manager at ten o'clock Monday morning. The two lads appearetl together, and were shown into the private office. The keen eyes looked them over. They were a liely pair. lie saw that upon the surface nothing ap- peared whicli miglit furnisli a dlue as to wliich would lie the better choice. Turning to, one of tliem ho said : \"Wliat were you doing yesterday afternoon ?1 The lad addressed anawered : 'II wus at Sunday School ; we have a fine clans and out teselier is just splendid. None of the fellows would miss for anything?' To the other lad lie put tlie sanie question but the reply was quite different. III went with a chum for a long auto ride in the country, and goV home late, dead tired.» \"'That setties it,\" said the manager, turning back to, the first boy, \"'you may begin to- morrow rnorning.\" The boy faithful to, lis Sunday School clasm and finding in its attend- ance a congenial way o! spending Sunday sfternoon, wse likely to posaws the dharacter fay, June, i916 No. 2 which would be honest in business and true to, the trust placed ini its possessor.

Jump, this way,\" sliouted the man with the megaphone at the annual Sunday Sehool picnic. \"Corne on, Jini, we will simply make you jump.\" The other members of the clasa hauled the reluctant Jim up to the IItake off\" board. Jira had neyer competed ini \u0026ny athietie events. Rie knew lie could not win first, second or third place, and ini the past there liad been no other incentives offered. These gaines were on a different basis. They were being conducted as outlined in the Canadian Standard Efficiency Test handbook. \"Do your best, old feilow. You will lie sure to, count something for oui clas, and we need ail the points we ean geV to beat the Excelsiors\"' Jim jumped, and scored twentyý-two points. That day, every boy in the class entered every event. The foilowing evening, Jim!s father dis- covered him digging in the back yard and was infornieed that lie was preparing a jumping pit. '\"I arn going to start training. Next year PUi make a better score for our clans, or something will liappen.\" Jim was deter- inined. Duxing the week, Mr. Moore, Jim's Sunday School teacher, cliarted hin. This revealed *The socond of four artiolos on tho Canadian Stand- ard Efficienoy Teste",
         "The Home Study Quarterly a very low standard in physical development and little interest in physical education and health habits. Early in October, the elass commenced holding midweek sessions. The first talk wss by Dr. Black on Healtli Education. Amongst tlie many good thinge lie said, the following impressed Jixa: \"It is the flabby- muscled boys wlio most ensily.go to tlie bad. Criminals are not big, strong, strapping fel- lows. Statisties show that as a chies they are below par pliysically. There is a very close conneetion between muscle and morality. A weak body encourages selfishness.\" E That niglit, Jin resolved to, commence the health education tests at once. lie slept with his window wide open, and rose in the mora- ing fifteen minutes earlier than usual, turned on the cold water tap and, while the bath waq flHlng, went through tlie physical exercises. A brisk rub-down after the cold plunge pro- duced a tbrill t hat made hùm ahnost shout for joy. After the prescribed teeth-cleaning and glass of water, lie was ready for the morning wateh witli the master traîner. During the winter season, several talks and tests were conducted, but what gripped hlm most was tlie tslk on The Cliaracter-building Value of Teain Play. As le glanced over bis notes that niglit before retiring, lie read, \"Play is one of God's best metliods cf teand- ing us liow to live. As a boy plays, se will lie live. The boy wlio is crooked and mean in lis play will be dishonest in business. 'Sacrifice bits' in basebali are the forerunners of sacrifice and service 'in everyday life.\"' Aithougli Jixa lad neyer played any of tlie regular teaxa gaines because lie was not goo-d enougli to be dhosen, bis opportunity came when Mr. Moore snnounced that every mcm- ber of the clas must play la at lest, flfteen tesin gaines during the yesr and that tliey would start witli hockey at once. Just before closing the fail and winter pro- gramme, the entire chies was entliused by a talk from a man wlio loved the out-of-doors. Eis subject was Campcraft. This resulted la a ten days outing where several members passed their swimming tests and quaiid for the running, jumping and throwing bars. Toronto Making Bibles for Oneself It is not possible to get inspiration froni a source with whieh one lias no connection, and the whole tnsk of those attempting to give to the girl a workable religion is the task of making connections with the source of power. Some time ago I observed the svork of an instructor atteinpting to make the cc\u003ennec- tion through the study of the Bible. She kne' that telling a girl to read lier Bible is not helping or training lier to do it. lier girls lad purchased ten and twenty- cent Testaments, which could be eut, and smnall loose-leaf notebooke, on the covers of which were pasted one of the pietures of Christ, and had spenli two weeks clipping from the Testaments and pasting in their note-books \"the thinge that Jesus said about himself and the words God spoke concerning hlm.\" Two weeks more were spent clipping tlie \"lthings others said about lia, \"-Peter, Paul, John, the Pharisees. The next work was to clip wliat Jesus said about forgive- ncss, about one's duty to neiglibors, treatment of one's enemies, the way to be happy. Later they were to use botli Old and New Testa- ments, eutting out the verses whieli they thouglit would be of comfort to any one in sorrow, to one wlio liad greatly sinned, and verses which they considered good advice to young people. That instructor was making a sane, prac- tical atternpt to feed the souls of those girls by helping themn seareli out for theraselves wliat the Bible lias to say on topics of real interest. I saw a notebook recently prepared by a flfteen-year-old girl whidli I believe most valuable, because of the things about whicli it lias led lier to think. She liad taken as the subjeet of lier book, \"The Good Shep- herd.\"' On the cover was a pieture witli tliat title ; in the inside a good collection of pic- tures representing Jesus as the Good Sliep- herd, dlippings regarding: Oriental sliepherd life, the Sliepherd Pealin, the Parable of the Lost Sheep, and tlie words of hymans like \"The Ninety and Nine\" and poems, like \"'That Li'l Black Sheep.\" One cannot soon forget that book, witi ts decorated margin, its neat mounting of carde",
         "'rhe Beautiful Life and elippinge, and its beautiful pictures. The effeet of the book upon the girl wlio made it, the teacliers said, was very apparent. Another book was entitled, \"Corne Unto Me,\" and the pictures, verses and hymne were most impressive. When each girl lias exchanged books with each member of tlie clase, they are to be sent to a rescue home for girls. The Bible messages to mankind brought by t;-,ch simple methods into direct contact with ,i girl in het early teene is one means of neurishing her soul. If it is true that the best in poetry, art, literature and oratory, as well as the greatest uplift to character, finds its source in that book, the girl should corne into real toucli with it, that it may'feed lier expanding soul. It le this sort of first-liand, individual study whlle she le stili a girl which will help lier Inter to turn to the book for encouragement, comfort and strengtli, and lead her to great thoughts and the attempting of great things because lier own soul is in- spired.-Margaret Slattery, in The Girl and Rer Religion The Beautiful Life One day, as Dr. -, the minister of a large city churcli, was in li 's study, a young Japan- ese cailed upon hlm. When tlie maid opened the door, the young man entered very abruptly, and said, '\"Sir, can. you tell me liow te, find the beautiful life?Il Dr. - answered, \"Do you wisli to talk witli me about religion V\" \"No, sir, I merely want to find ont about the beautiful life.\" \"Have you ever read the Bible ?\" \"Yes, sir, I have rend some, but I don't like the Bible.\" \"Have you ever been to, church VI \"Yee, I have been twice, but I don't like the churcli.

It sounde like it ; but liow can I get it ?\"I Then Dr. - took that wonderful story of the perfectly beautiful life, and tried to tell hlm, very simply, and eaid : \"Now, you have just to follow that Life.\" And then, as lie was obllged to, go, lie gave liim a copy of the New Testament. Tlie Japanese asked : ceCan you not give me a more modern book? You know, the Japanese are very up-to-date.\" But lie eaid, 1'No, it le not in any other book, althougli I ean give you Borne other books that wiil he!p you ; but thie le the one Book you need.

The next day, liowever, juet at noon, he burst in as lie had done before, very abruptly, saying : \"My train leaves at two o'clock. 1 must take that train to catch the steamer at San Francisco, to go back to my own country. I have something to tell you.\" But lie did not need to tell one word. It was ail written on that radiant face. \"Sir, I have found the beautiful life.

From Beggar Boy to Missionary A STORY FROMa INDIA By Rev. Frank Russell, M.A. Hie was a ragged littie Hindu, unkempt and dirty, with only one leg. One day in the crowded bazaar lie liad been knocked down under the lieavy wheel of a passing ox-cart. Hie was hurried off to, the charitable hospital, where the native surgeon took off hie leg at the knee. To-day lie was tired and hungry. Fie had worked lis way to the house of the ricli Parsee, Merwanjee, wlio gave out pice (cop- pers) once a week to the beggars of the town. But lie met a disappointed crowd coming away. Some one had died in the Parsee liousehold, and for to-day there would lie no dole for the beggars. As lie sat down to rest for a few moments under the sliadow of a higli wail on the side of the road, lie heard voices singing. Fie sihuffled along to the gateway of the compound (enclosure), and peepcd inside. He saw to bis surprise the group of beggars who lad lef t hlm some time before, sitting under the spreading branches of a peepul tree, listening to two or tliree missionaries who were singing sometliing fromn a little booki they lield ini thei- hand\u0026. The singing went on. As lie listened, lie heard some words repeated over and over again : Yishu Masili mero prana bachaiya (\"lJesus Christ saves my soul\"). There was much else that lie did not understand, but these words struck him. He fell to wonder- ing who this Yishu Ma8ili miglit lie. Fie muet lie some one belonging to the ,Sirkar (Government), or these sahibs (gentlemen) would not be talking about hlm. But now the singing liad ceased, and one of the men waesepeaking. The boy listened for a few minutes, but the day was hot, and the corner of the wail under the shade of 'the tree very comfortable, se before long lie began to làod. A sudden movement of the crowd roused hlm, from his drowsy corner. The beggars were passing out of the gate, eacli one as lie went receiving a coin froin the biand of the missionary who bad been speaking. The boy lield back until ail liad gone, and then went slowly forward. \"Hallo 1\" said the mission- nry, \"liere's arnther one, and I don't believe I've a single 'double' (cent) left?\" Fie put hies band in bis pocket and drew it out again. «\"Here's one,\" lie said, and lianded the boy a coin. The boy took it, but what was hi8 amazement to see that it was not a copper, but a silver rupee, worth 32 cents. Fie had neyer possessed sucli a sum in hie life. Next morning lie wae back at the place where the beggars had gatliercd the day before. Soon after along came a bicycle, and his friend of yesterday jumped off at the gate. The missionary asked hlm a number of ques- tions about himeif and lis daily life. Wlien lie found that lie had no home or friends, lie asked hlm. if lie would like to go to a home wliere lie would have good food and clothes, and some one to care for hlm. Soon lie ws in the new home, washed and dressed, and with à wonderful wooden leg, working liard at school learning to read and write. By and by lie grew to manliood and joined tlie ranks of those wlio are telling the people of India the story of Jesus.
