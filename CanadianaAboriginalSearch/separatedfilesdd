WHAT is truly saiti is true no matter who says it, anti Rudyard Kipling, who le not necessariiy a gooti politician ci' an econo- mist, long ago, gave protounti expression to n profounti principle.

Lt le the \"Orientai\" problema that is troubling the people of Canada to-day. 1 amn, perbape, mistaken exceptîng in the.assumption that the \"people o!

I arn quite sure that people genereliy would lîke to have a reiiehlp statement of fact as to the evolution o! the resýistance that bas been urgeti against the admission of Hindus loto Britishi Columbia anti as to the general anti persistent objection to the admission of Orientais of every cleses inte tbis country. British Columbia, et thie present moment, bas, un- fortunetely, become the \"storin centre\" for al Canada, anti for the whoie empire as regards the question of Ori ental immigration. This às not be- cause Britishi Columbia le not a part of Canada, nor beceuse It Is not a part of the Britishi Empire, but because It le the part of Canada and of the Britilsh Empire wbich le most vitaily affecteti by the in- cursion of Orientais. By the lest phrase I mean much more than the \"competition\" of Oriental labour wlth tbat of other classes, both Anglo-Saxon anti otherwise \"European.\" The confliet betweeu Europeau anti Asiatie standards cf living le the crux o! the whole business. Lt does not matter from, which \"European\" country immigrants corns Into Britishi Columbia. These immigrants have alweys seemeti capable of \"Irleng\" to somethiug approachable anti recognizable as the \"Europeen\", standard of living. It le true that some classes from, severai of the provinces of Europe have been able for e time, anti are stilll able, to subsiet, anti to be con- tent, with les wages than the recogulzed standard of Anglo- Saxon Épeoples.

Lt le the close deduction whlch the \"industriel magnete\" is always compelleti to make \"for value receiveti\" that gives the Oriental a preference over the white ma.n. But the Orienitais spenti their lnoney among them- selves. They melutain the moat rigiti racial dis- tinctions. They establlsh their own stores for the negotiatlon o! the commedities they need as the imperative perqulsites o! life, anti they buy, within the limits o! thelr neeti, from their own country~men Orly.

This sort of thing was all right lu the eariy days in this province, when nobotiy careti or nobody really knew, but it Is different to-day. The slant-eyed Oriental bas been more far-seeing than lis usuaily Hotel owned by a Chinaman in Victoria. A Dairy Farm owned by a Hindlu near VictorIa, B.C. siewer-vlsloned brother of the White clase, but the awakeulng of the latter lias come. That le, perliape, the explanation of the awakeuiug o! tbis Western country to its danger; an awakening whlch, unfortunately, le flndlng Its climax anti its culmination lu a revoit agaluet the Invasion of that particular branch of Hie Majesty'subjects known as the Hindus. Let me speak for Britishi Columbla-anti challenge me Who wlll-the revoit of the Western people of thae Dominion of Canada is NOT agaiust Hindus, but against \"Orientale,\" whatever natlouallty they may dlaim. The present impact o! the Hindu subjecte, or allegeti subjecte, of Hie Majesty, le not what the People of Britishi Columbia are fightiug about. The question le one too blg to (be matie the subject of political badinage, nîthougli, unfortunately, it lias been miade so. The solution, as fer as the West le, concerneti, anti, perhaps, as fer as the Empire le concerneti, Is rot one lu whlcli politiciens may exelalil, \"heeds I wJ.u, tale you lose.\" My undertaklflg le to, \"show cause\" or, lu other werds, te justify the attitude of the people o! British Columbia agaînet what le believed to be au \"Orientai\" invasion. When, iu the early '80's, durlng the construction o! the Canadien Pacifie Rallway through the Rockles, it was founti ativantegeous to import \"coolie\" labour froni Chine, there were few Anglo-Saxon people lu the province. The Orientais, once havlng geined a f oothold, saw their opportunlty anti have, ever since, asslduously presecuted every ativantage that the pecullar conditions andi traditions o! the province afford. The enrleet populeteti part of British Col- umbia (Vancouver Islandi) was a Crowni colony. Some of the traditions o! the \"feudal\u003e systein stili i emalu with the \"Peole of partis\" lu the former Crewn colony anti the distinction between \"meuils\"' anti these of the \"classes\" is rigidly maitned. The Oriental supples a long-felt want, for lie is peculiai adapted to the role of a menial. The term \"menial\" is rarely employeti Eiast of t Rockies for the reason that there Is no such thoui in the mmnd of anyone as the thouglit of a I\"slav In the older provinces the term \"wage-earner\" mnef one of two things-eitler an industrial employee an \"hired man.\" The distinction le between the cl! of employment in industriel centres and.in the ru districts. In British Columbia there are certl classes of empioyment which are neyer engageti excepting by \"meuils.\" The term \"helotry\" le 1 understood iu Eastern Canada, and most of Y( reatiere wili have to go to the dictioflary to gel clear idea of 'what it means. Yet lu Britishi Columi helotry Is the aibsolute condition anti clase statue the Oriental, no matter from what country may hall. W E have, in this province, that heritage of se ment which survives from the days of Crown colony, andi the plutocrats are una to relieve themnselves of the swatidllng clothes that heritage. Many wealthy citizens einP Chinese gardeners becau 'se they will work for ab a dollar a day, a place to sleep and their boardi. Anglo-Saxon will do this. But from a condition of heiotry the more ast among the Orientai,% have evolveti into sometb better. It is not altogether the \"coolie\" who been a curse to the country; it le his \"boss.\" of the characteristics of the 'Oriental is that lie s no incongruity in being both a labourer anti capitalist at the same time. And lie is both these, not because lie le all things to ail menl, because lie is ahl things unto him-self. He is shrew-d as the Anglo-Saxon lu sc ing a bargain iu real estate, speculative stocks or in a busil opportunity. The Oriental c talist Invades every sanctuarY Anglo-Saxon plunder, and pluiin as shrewdly and unscrupulousîl lis White brother. The labouX were the flrst to -feel the coi tion made intolerable by the 10 standards of living of the Asie1 but durlng later years the buelJJ concerns of the province are ginuing to realîze that what happened ln other countries about to happen here.

The sandy spits bore the arro-pointed lmpress o! the blacktail, the big pads o! the black bears-and sometimes a bigger one still that toltI a huge grizzly was wandering along tbis lonely creek. It seemed highly probable tint a white man's foot biad nover entered this scene. \"Look!\" caIleil Frýitz, \"the footmarks o! a child'\" Thero, firmly imprlnted among the medley of wild animal trails, was the clear mark cf a child's naked, .-tubby foot.

When McGill was pusbing V ts campalgu for fuda few years ugo, mighty few ways in wbich a communlty can invest rnuey with a surer hope of dividends tlian in edu- cation--and this applies to higlier as weil as to the commoner branches of edlucation. Everybody wili agree with this theory as applied to the common scliool; but there are some wlio boggie over it ehen applled to the university. That le because of a mis- taken belief that the unlverstty is a iuxury of the -well-to-do. It is nothiug o! the sort. It is a door of opportunity for the ambitious and thie determiued .and the plucky and the Industrious. It is o! far greater value, indeed, to the poor than to the ricli. Without it, the sonis of the poor mught neyer get au opportunity; w1hile the sons5 o! the ricli would have their fiyiug-start in life lu any case. Moreover, the sons of the poor almost always make far better use of it. Many a ricli boy finds his ruin ln the uni- *verslty. That Is not the fault of -the college, but usually of the pirent who loves the ostentation o! glvlugls son more*money than Is good for him. M ANY o! the men wh'om I kuew wheu lu coilege were worklug their owu way through. Rlch? They badn't a penny tbat they dldu't earn in -vacation-tme. It was flot weaIth that brouglit thern to coliege, but courage and determination. What they wouild have done, If there had been no0 college to go to, I eau only conjecture. Undoubtedly, Young men wlth sucli good stuif lu them wouid have lemerged somewhere. I arn not a prlg who holds that a coliege education Is a necessity to a good man. But every good man l'have. ever taiked wlth asserts that ýt Is a great beip. The open-door of the uni- versity offers to many a Young fellow the oniy way of escape from au otberwIse sordid life of drudgery, so that le bas thea drivîng-power to get bimself through college, but lie lacks the genlus to mnake býis way iu life without a college training. 0 NE o! the alternatives suggested in lieu of getting more funds for 'Varsity, is .to raise the fees. That would le a crime. What sbould be done, indeed, Is to abolisb ail fees. There is no reason in the world why a provincial university like 'Varsity should not be absolutely free to ail-corners. The great tJniversity o! the Sorbonne, lu Paris, is !ree- not oniy to ail Frendlimen-but to ail foreigners. You, who are reading tbese uines, cau go to Paris and enter your naines for the free courses lu the Sorbonne, where you wili bear lectures by the first professors In France on ail the subjects of a uni- versity course. Neither poverty nor race nor age ils any bar. Soame o! the more popular academie lectures lu this splendid universlty are crowded to the doors-a tribute alike to the generosity of te French nation and the appetite for knowledge of the Freuchi people. 'T HE continental universities are not mucli botbeýred ibythe .\"prankishness\" of our coilege popula- tion this side of the water.' Tbey are far too serlous. Life ils too mucli o! a struggle over there- competition is too severe-the rare opportunitie-s o! college training too higbly esteemed. A Harvard professor,.who \"exdbanged\" with a professor o! the Sorbonne, was amazed at the wonderful earnestness of the satudents lie tauglit. AMter lecture, It was the customary tbiug for many of then to follow him to bis quarters to ask hlm questions about bis lecture and to eagerly dlscuss anythilg novel lie had said. His experience in Harvard had neyer given him a parallel to this. We will gel this spirit lu our col- leges when ýour economnic coniditions out here tigliten up a bit; but one step toward it, whloh might be take-n at once, would be to -aboliali fees and throw the doors open wide to the \"climbers\" amný,ng out Through a Monocle ~zz~i. - - - - .2~--E ~ -~-- ~-~- :\" A POLICE CRUISER .MISS CANADA (AS THE RAINBOW ESCORTS THE SIKHS BEYOND THE 3..MILE LIMIT):-\"WHILE OUR NAVAL PROGRAMME IS PENDING, WOULD'NT LT, BE ADVISABLE TO KEEP THE POLICEMAN STEADY ON THE JOB?\" Young people.

The lunatic who dld the deed was a Sel-vlan af Bosnia. That he did lit on behaif of a large section of servie Is proved by the refusai of the Servian Government to, make the amende aeked for b\u003e' Austria. Servis has designs of national greatness contrary ta the Pan-Germanie Idea. The Archduke Ferd inand hed proved himeif ta be In favaur of a Pan- Germanic consolidation acrass Europe against the Siav empire. He was the actual ruler of Austria.. Hoe was the protaganlet of a greater Auistria which should Include a union of ail the SiavIc provinces loto a triple gavernment, the third part ta contain BopnIla and Herzegovltla an- nexed In 1908 thraugh hie influence, along with Croatie, Daimatia, Siavonla, latrie and Krain. He was behind the movement ta exclude servie iram the Adrletic In 1913. He was as much hated in Servia, whIch had Its awn diream of national expansion as the Emperor Frenz Josef wes beioved In Austria and respected b\u003e' Europe.

Corruption in New Brunswick S YMPATHY from mst students of politis wil be extendeti to New Brunswick lIn this hour 0 trial. Its sore, a long hidden festering sore has been laid open to the public gaze. For years ail( years, the province bas suffereti !rom corruption an' log-rolling among lis so-called \"'stateýsmen.\" Tht corruption bas been so bad that the commercial MEf blooti o! the province was sappeti, except in the cit~ o! St. John. Mentally, socially and coinlmerciall. there couli nlot be progresas wben sucba 10w politicil ideals existeti. Hence the disclosures, thougb severs and trying, must have a beneficial effect. The Valley Railway bas been the mllcb. cow o! ai the pollicians4 and the lumbering Industry a mer side-line in comparison. But it is nlot sa mucb th partîcular way of collecting money whlch labels th politician-s o! tbls unfortuflate province, it was tb universality of it. Indeeti, every leadlng polîtician i New Brunswick for more than a genreration bas bee forced to play the part eltber o! a corruptionist or hypocrite. When the present Investigatixig commiR sien reports, the air will be cleareti and the cons' quent discussion wîll no doubt benefit the poltIci life of the Province enormously.

Three Interesting Cases A ttde last session of the Ontario Legislature was founti necessary to pass a special Act preventa member front being unseatedt cause he hall acted as a commîssionier to invest!i certain matters at the request o! the DomInion O ernment.

The Battie of Vancouver CANADA bas been fairly free of wars and battles, but at last we bave had a near-battle wlicb wi live lu our his-torical annals. Three hun- dred and fifty Hindus, inostly Sikhbs froin the cold bill country, arrlved on a Japanese collier and anchored iu Vancouver Harbour. Tbe Immigration officiaIs refused to allow tbem to land because tJbey were Orientais and had not corne direct from the land of tbeir birtb. TIien the trouble began. For rno\u0026t o! the turne, tbe police officiais kept the eeumy at bay-tbat la, on the vessel. But the gentle, subtle Hindu remained unmoved. Fiually, It was decided te use force. A tug-load of policemen drew up alongside the collier and began to play atreaIns of water on those innocent seekers after niew hoines lu the land of Christian freedoin. Tbe conflned Hîndus responded with ehunks o! coal, billets O! wood and trou, and such-llke Innocent but effective weapons. Tbe police retaliated. Tben the Goverumeut took sterner ineasures. They ordere tbe dlsmantled \"Rainbow\" Into commission, and the amialler bal! of the Laurier tin-pot navy was hurriedly rusbed froin Victoria to the scene o! action. Tbe crew was relnforced by two hundred naval men frOun tbe \"Niobe,\" also disinantled ut Halifax, being the otber biaif of the said tin-pot navy. Iu reserve Were sevei'al companies o! mlItia. The -situation looked bloody. But the wily Hindu WS.1 Mlatched by an equally wily governulent. Before ftring a sabot the representative of His Majesty tried anot1ber device. He offered money sud -food, beer, abIeep) and cbickens, if the Hindus would but be eod and let the Japanese captain take is dlrty old vessel OUtaide Canýadian waters. Finally, the Hindu Yielde,-d and on Thursday of last week, the battie ended witbout a flash o! sinokeless gun-powder. Tbe collierý salied away, escorted by the Canadian uavy.

THE LI(F)E EVERL.ASTING. HT OW Many good, new stories are lturned out *each year? How many good, aew storles are there to tura ont? There ean't be a very great numnler, judging by the stack of old ones that are resurrected every siily season. Trhere was a friend of my youthl w,,ho was an adept at telliag stories- tales, 1 mean. I don't think lie made a practice of telag the other sort o! storles, because lie was a gentleman o' the cloth, and liad been for many ye2ars, when 1 knew hlm furst. 1 thlnk lie was the best story-teller I ever knew. He once \"warranted\"-of course, he couldn't bet-that lie would tell sixty stories in as many minutes, and le won his \"warran.t,\" for lie told sixty-three. He was a cynical old man, too, and particularly on the subject o! new storles. I rememýber lie had a stuat, sc;mething like Morton's Fork, which. was such a help in filling the coffers of ithe first Tudor King. He would offer a prize of a sovereign for a really good, new story. \"But it must, of course, be a really good new one,\" lie would conclude. And, for a gentleman of the cloth, lie was very wlly. If, by any chance, you got hold of a s-tory that was clever, aad retailed It to the old man, lie would gravely pull at his beard, and say, \"Umn, yes. It Is a good story, but you know It lsn't new. Why 1 heard So-and-so tell a yarn whlch had exactly the same point,\" etc., etc. And, If you despaired of earning the sovereign by that metliod, and manu- ftctured a story on the sp:ot, feeling certain that nobody liad ever heard il, or one like It, before, the reverend doctor would say, \"Well, 1 must'con- fess that thnt is quite a new story to me. I have neyer heard it be- fore.\" (And liere your hopes would rise.) \"But, you know, lt's a wretclied thing! It's so thin tlnt, It couldn't raise a laugh from a lady prone to hy steria.\" iSo you coulda't win that sovereign either way. It remained safe la tlie pocket of the modern Cardinal Mor- ton. This resurrection of stories be- comes a pest. A cat may have aine lives, but some storles I know have ninety-nine point aine recurrîng, par- ticularly the recurring. You ýcan take them to the 'n'th power. Here's ai. instance. Last year \"Lipplincott's Magazine\" had the following story: \"W-HO'S LYIN' 'ERE?\" Richard Harding Davis had an amus- ing experience while on a recent visit to Engiand. Whilst motoring tlirough the country, lis Party stopped to se an old cliurch. The native guide was show- ing the party through, expiaining ail the points of interest alter his own style. \"In the far corner of this 'ere churcoh,\" lie said, \"lies William the Conker; be'ind the organ, wliere yere can't see, are tomlbs 0f Guy Fawkes, Robin 'ood, and Cardinal Wolsey. Now, sir,\" lie said, addressing Davis, \"does that there guide book as I sees you 'ave in yer baud tell you os lyla' 'ere?\" \"No,\" replied Davis, candidiy, \"the 'book says nothlng of it, but I can guess.\" Two- weeks ago the \"Saturday Evening Post\" coataiaed this: SUSPICIONS WELL GROUNDED. An Engiish caretaker was showing a party of 4merican visitors througli an ancient Engiisli cathedral, \"B1e'ind the altar,\" lie said, \"îlies buried Richard tlie Liou-'earted.

The Metropolitan shareholders COmmenced business in November, 1902, with a paid-up capital of one million and a rest of one million. Thie stock was issued at $200, or $100 premium. In 1896 the stock was selling around 192 and paying 8 per cent. Since then there have been very few sales, the price ranging from 190 to, 211. This sale gives the stockholders $232 a share, or which $100 18 ln cash and the rest in Bank of Nova Scotia stock.

Orientizing Our Pacific Province \u003cConcluded from page 6.) the people of British Cohumbia-ex- cepting \"certain lufluential classes,\" to quote Victoria's representative ln the House of Cominons, are becom- ing alarmed. Tley see, ahready, the hand-writing on the wall and sliudder to thinli of what may happen If the Asiatic invasion continues. As for tlie Hindus, whose case is lu tle immediate melting pot, tliey are in a pecuhiar category. Japanese come pretty freely into tle country, and Chluese, by paying the \"head-tax,\" have still wîder privileges of entry. The poor Hindu, British subject, no1 better nor worse than any other class of Asiatics and on a bigler level than many European Immigrants, Is refused admittance. To do him, justice, tle Hindu wants no more than \"fair play.\" On the slip lu Vancouver harbour lu whlcb some 300 Hîndus were \"marooued\" while the Immigration authoriîes made indIvidual Inquiry respecting every lntending immigrant the ma- rooned*Éindus, flnahly refused admit- tance, lad the unimaginable vexation of winessing the landing of both Chînese and Japanese from steamers arrlving ut the port long after their own. The haw as ît applies to Japs and Chinese Is simple, thnt apphylng to Rindus is complicated, and statesmen have still a long way to traveh before tley establish an equitable system. Now is it no idle boast to say that -u the minas of the Hindus--It Is not Anglo-Saxon cîilizatlon thýat Is lu tlie crucible, It is Clristlanîty itself. Our plous, cliurch-going statesmen might as w eh reahize tînt fact first as hast.

The rnlsforiune Is that the eccleslas- tical dogma together wlth the theorles related to It or begotten by It must go dowu lu this provhnce before the higher haw of self.preservatiou. While I believe thai the doctrines of Christlanity are Indissoluble and- the foundations of the Christian Faît4 are unshaken, I agree wltb the Hindu that It Is time these doctrines are Put 10 île test. I have no doubt as 10 the ultimate result, but we are flot yet lIn the Miheieul age. In the meantime the Hindus who are knocldug at tue doors of this country are slmply tali- iug a great \"Christian\" nation at lis word.
