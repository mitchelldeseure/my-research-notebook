         "CANÂDIAN COUJRIER. Isaac Jbbotson, M.P., In terviïewed The Member for Moptovin, Ont., Clears Up Some Misconceptions and Does a Little Talking Oui in Meeting A bout Public Servpice in the House of Commons WHEN you a.- tryng to do sometbng, na matter how iall, to reform the State, ît's an awful ti. g to be misunderstooi. Isaac Ibbotson, M.P., bas been misunder- stooti by bis fellow members at Ottawa. I have taiketi with members wbo confess that they don't quite, know what Ibbotson was driving at in the speech that came so near maklng hlm. famous lot long ago. Ibbotson, you will remember, got Up to inake a reform speech, wbich reformeti uotbing, got the colti shoulder from bis own party and warm criticisin from. the otber aide, and vowed be neyer would get up in tbe House ta make another such a speech. Letters bave reached the \"Courier\" office which sbow plainly that tbe wrlters did not untierstand Ibbotson. Tbey point out bow Isaac might have really done sometbing If he bad only done wbat they ativise Insteati of thinklng for hlmself. Now what was tbe reason of this? Either Ibbotson inuat bave loat faith ln bis own convictions wben ho attemptod to put a reforin speech across on the Hanse, or olse there ls some cocksure macblnery In tbe House of Commons tbat acta as an automnatlc gag upon tbe member wbo doesn't feol the pulse of Mis own party. Somebow I fancy that a good deal e! the fault was Ibbotson's. HIe ougbt to bave known that be couldn't get up as plain, obscure Isaac Ibbot- son andi hope ta get away wlth a reforin speech wlth- out uslng a megaphone. Any man wbo undertakes ta speak without the backiug of bis party ln the 'House bas one awful coutract. HIe needa ta be a m1ore or less Illegitimate crauk wbo doesn't give a rip what ridicule be gots, or wbat tommyrot he may soem ta be banding out. Ho must be more than a critie or a constructive reformer wlth a conscience. .H1e muet be an ali-on-fire enthuslast who naturally plays ta tbe 'gallery and bas lu bis mlnd's oye just bow tbat f001 reforin speech ho Intends ta makre will loo0k wben lt's translated Into black scarebeads fIve columans wlde. Now I tinlIt aIl over I caudldly dou't believe, Ibbot8on la that kînti o! man. What would Martin Luther bave doue If he bati beau quietly reusonable? ~Iow 'would Frank Carveil, M.P., ever manage ta jget the our of the Commons If be didn't slanigwbaug oomebody on the other aide of the House just as tbougb be bad hlm lu tbe prize ring? Wbat would R. B. Beunett do If ha sbould get up and talk Ilke a perfect Chesterfioldian gentleman? Would George E. Poster ever bave got the halo of the chief debater lu dommons If be hadn't laid down the law every timo lia got Up witb the feraclty of a blacksmlth lambasting :A red-bot horso-sboe? N 0, 1 realized that Ibbotson bad been ultogether too humble. He hati not loarnoti how ta play tbe raie of sublime egotist. Ho hai got up tc, piake a big speech without ever havIng oponed bis jnouth lu the House before, aud refused ta talký througb the party megàphone. This conclusion seemet i nevitable froin the toue of one ef the letters wbicb camne from a vory reason- #ble, momber, as may bo seen froin the contents: \"The point la well made that a lot of time la 4vasted by membera of Parliameut durlug Ses- pion.

         "to this phase of the question would perbaps explain how groundless are any criticisma that are directed against so-called sectionalism.\" \"Weil,\" hie said,' \"somebody got under bis belt.\" \"Ponderous tommyrot, anyway. But that's a very absurd argument. The B.N.A. gave to the provinces certain representative rights. 0f course it did. But it neyer intended that the member for Great Bear Lake, if we ever get one, should spend the time of the Commons in telling tbe mtember for Cod Co., N.S., bow the Yellow-Knives keep buskie dogs from cbewing shaganappi for breakfast. Parliament has no0 time to be a session of the Royal Geographical Society. 1 hope we have departmental experts who can look after ahl these local cohour questions.\" Ibbotson read again fromn the same letter: \"Under our system, that of party goverament, a Private member bas little influence to initiate legialation. As a matter 0f fact, in these days par ticuîarîy, it la impossible for a member-I care not what bis measure of ability may be- te aucceed witb any mes sure of legislation for the advancement of social or other conditions without enlisting the initiative of the govern- ment.

But that's onîy useful to the country when it concerna public matters. For instance, the Naval Aid Bill never should have been a party measure; neither should Home Rule in Ireland. These are problemas that develop clear outside of a party altogether. It's asinine to claim, for Instance, that the Tory party in Canada has ever bad or ever can have anything like a monopoly of Imperial sentiment. Both parties know how to wave the old flag In an election if they consider the old flag a good vote-producer. They've both done It. Both parties believe in getting the goodwlll of the farmers, and if the Conservatîves to-day could square free implements with the anti- recIprocity wave that put thema in power in 1911- do you think they wouldn't consider It?\" \"But there is no need.

But even the Conservativea would have corne to that as a matter of party polcy. \"Besides,\" Ibbotson added as bis eye caught another soul-searchlng passage In the letter, \"there are loads of questions upon wblcb there neyer can be any really sensible difference of opinion except in the details of worklng them out. I mentioned soel of them In my unfortunate speech. There are others. Now, here's a real îlluminative passage that sums Up the whole situation in thia country so far as it con- cerns people and parliament.\" He read with considerable emphasis: \"There is a necessity in Canada to-day foi, progressive and advanced legislation, and T assume that the Goverament, If they felt that the people were demanding action, would takre it A Fine Winter Picture of a Clever Oui 7 spiritt and ceonsclince sthroulghoutthe whole breadtb o! our land, and it seems to me this lack la growing more noticeable year by year.\" \"Now,\" hie concluded, pointing impressively at the tip of my nose, \"how in the naine of patrlotism, wbat- ever that ia, can this country ever get a national conscience without a parliamentary conscience? If the men who, because o! their public and persona] fltness, are chosen to represent the people can't as a community on Parliament Hill develop sucb a conscience, how can they expect a heterogeneous community acattered over thousands of miles under ail sorts of conditions to do it? \"Parliament is an index, you say?

The United Farmers of Ontario By W. W. SWANSON Department of Political and Economical Science, Queen'a Univetsity THOUGH agriculture la our oldesi and by fr our mosi important lndustry, hi bas only re- cently occurred to us that in Canada we have a rural problem o! surpassing magni- tude and importance. Nations, liko Individuals, are prone toe prise the ibinga they do not bave raiher iban the ibinga ihoy bave. Agriculture la s0 natural to our conditions, and bas establisbed hIseif s0 easly, ibat we bave taken It as a matter ot course, and have contred our attention on Industries that bave not sbown a iendency te grow naturally. The resuli bas been the rapid building up of great citles and the creation of a group of urban social problems wh wbicb we are eniireiy unprepared to deal. The urban probiem bas faced us wiih dramaiic sudden- ness, and such bas been our surprise ihat we bave overlooked tbe fact ibat tbere la aise an equaliy pressing rural problem. The pressure of the cosi of living ha ai ait turning our attention to the public anti social, as well as the business, aspects 0f ibis rural question. Oneo0f the mosi significani attempia to grappie with the problems of rural life In Canada, with special roferonce to conditions ln Ontarlo, was seen ai the recent gaihoring o! farmers at the Labour Temple, Toronto, on March 19 and 20. The main objeci of thia meeting was to organise the farmers' socleties of Ontario Into a airong provincial organisation for tbe furibering o! ibeir common Interests. Much bas been done by separato socioties la roconi yoars, but ihere bas beeuno 0Indication that the farmers o! the province suffhcienitly reallze bow closely relaieti thoir Interesis are. Much leas-ht may be remarked in1 passIng-have ibey untiersiood how vitally the far- mer's prosperity depentis upon tbe progress andi growtb of the other great Industries o! Canada; and bow, Ia a word, the wbole economic Ilfe 0f the nation deponds upon the growth and progress of oach in- dustry. Even now demagogues are 2busy In ibis country, wlth theirmalevoleni achemes ho humn clasa againat cas.. The manufacturera, ihe wholesalers and the rahîroada deserve, a square deal equally wIth the farmers. A co-operativo commonwealth, wide enougb ho embrace'every phase o! industry and com- merce in Canada, la the true Ideal ho set bofore the peopile o! ibis nation. A 8bas been said, mucb bas been accompllsbeo Malready by the farmers tn co-perating for iboir mutual, intereats. There are scores of succesa- ful farmers' organisations la Ontario. These Include somo fifty-two co-operative fruit growors' associa- tions, the corn growers of Essex county, the Erie Farmers' Association of Haldimanti county \u003cwblcb last yoar solti some $100,000 worth o! choyer and grass seeti); the Cbatswortb Marketing Company, wbich handies largo quantities o! !arm produco for Its members; numorous Breeders' Clubs, whicb have belti a niunber o! succesaful sales of pure breti stock; the Farmers' Dairy Company, o! Toronto; Co-opera- tive Telephone Companios, and almosi 300 Farmers- Clubs anti Subordinahe Granges that have met wiib distinct succesa la the sohling of produce and the purcbaalng o! supplies on a co-operativo basis. Up to the preseni theso organisations have been carrylng oui their own plans entIrely by tbemsolvos, each absorbed in its own work. Few of themn have known much of whai the ethors were doing. But there are many Indications ai present te show thai farmers are alive ho the value of dloser union andi co-operathon. For examplo, someo0f the sooti andi cern growers' associations wisb te arrange for the direct sale o! iheir products te other farmers' or- ganisations. Many socleties have !ound 1h difflcult te purchase seetis, fertilisera, !eeding stuifs, salt, fencing, and smnlhar articles ln wholesale quanittes at a satisfactory price. Wblere orders bave been placed it bas been found that the goods bave often nlot come up to specifications. It is boped ailu i lieved that a strong provincial organisation can remedy these defects. It sbould not be overlooked that Ontario farmers expect the proposed provincial organisation to co- operate with the farmers of the other Canadian pro- vinces. For oxample, the farmers' organisations of Western Canada purchasod, during 1913, twenty- seven car-loads of Ontario apples. The West wants more of this trade, and aise dosires te buy from On- tario more of our dairy producta, boney, and pure- bred stock. In return tbey wisb teoseil to the far- mers of Ontario large quantities of thoir feeding stuifs. Hers Is a magnificent opportunity for suc- cessful co-operation. F OR some montbs previous to the convention in l'Toronto, an organiser bad been busy addressing farinera' organisations, in both oastern and western Ontario, with the objeet of lnterosting tbem ln the project, and of securing their views. Every- wbere the proposai to organise on a provincial baas met with enthusiastic support. As a resuit a con- vention 0f farmers was arranged for, and the same was c alled to order at the Labour Temple in Toronto on Marcb 19. h had tbe privîlegeo f attending the varlous sessions and 0f following the general discus- sions. The proceedinga opened with a series of ad- dresses by farmors wbo bave been the leading'spirits ln varlous co-operative societies that bave proved distinctiy successful. The speakers described the character of tbe work thoir organisations were carrying on, and the methoda tbey bave found to be moat succesaful. Addresses were aise given hy Mr. Roderick McKenzle of Winnipeg, a director of the Grain Growers' Company of Winnipeg. Tbe farmers assembled decided to establish two organisations ln Ontario similar tho thoso that bave provedl Wuccessful ln Western Canada. The firat of these la intended to be social and educational in character. i wll ho similar to the Grain Growers' Association 0f Manitoba and Saskatchewan and the United Farmers of Alberta., This Association wili Include In its membershhp, as brancb associations, as many of the farmnera' clubs, subordinate Granges and other local bodies la Ontario, as mnay identlfy themselves with It and adopt Its ruies. The second organisation ls commercial la character. hI wIll be buli along the linos of the Grain Growors' Grain Company of Winnipeg. This la the great commercial enterprise of the farmers of Western Canada. Last, yoar lt dld a business 0f between $50,000,000 and $60,000,000, had assois of $1,371,152 and earned profits of $164,000. A charter bas already ijeen secured for the proposed Ontario company, un4er the tute of The United Farmers' Co-operative Company; and h w111 endeavour to proieci and extenti the business Interests of the various local socleties. A committee bas been appolnted, and Io nnw ah wnrk, te pusb those proposais througb. The gonierai Impression that I recelved while ah- tendlng tbis convention was that the farmers moant business, but that many of tbem dIti not understand tbe true principies of co-oporation. In my jutigment the bosi speech was mnade by Mr. Anson Groh of Hespeler. He gave a clear, con1cise and interestlng talk% on Tbe Farmers' Telophono Companies o! On- tarià, and showed what bati beon actuaily accomp- Ilshedi by the co-operating of the farmers of bis district~ for mutual service. i was a matier of regret to see an attompt madie to tirag parit' polîtics Into the gaihoring, by those whose soif-interesi diciaieti such a course.

If tba volume o! business doas not show an increase o! twanty-fiva par cent. they Imagine they ara iosiug their grlp and that the country bas antared upon a retrograde ara. Thay are net happy unisse they are running te a lire. Se wlth our political life-we must have some scandai te talk about or we think that Polities are duli. The important mensures which make fer public happlIness, moral weifnre, and -national progress In- terest ouly a few thinklng people.

For Successful Farming SUCCESS ln farming ln Ontario depends, se far as the State lo cancerned, eu three great fac- tors: agricultural education, freadera from. com- mnicable Mieue, and goed roasi Givan thos, tbree, farming should be a pléasant and profitable industry for an Industrieus people. Yet Ontario la lamentably weak lu ail thase factors. Ontario bas ne couselidated rural. schois as Mont- toia bas. It has ne rural bîgh scheels as hava New Brunswick and Aiberta. It has ne text-boelc on agri- culture as bave British Columbia, Manitoba» aud Nova Scotia. It ls doing uothiug te ,educate the !armers chIldreu for farming life except by, a UIttla desultory, narrow-based nature study. Semething bas beau doue te ellminate bovin tuberculosis and te prevent Its transfer from animais te human beingu-but maInly thraugh private effert. The peerer farmers weuld object te stringent laws on thls subject and the department euly follows pub- lie sentiment, neyer leads. Snob Irinpoe matld as are lu vogue are due te the telacblng In the 0. A. C., and the preacbing lu the farm journals. As fer good roads, the Ontarle attempts te preduca tbem ara one large jeke. Ne ene in Canada ever built a road four feet deep, as tbey de lu the New !EugIand States and ln Great Brltain. Our geod roads are enly surfaced wltb Iron and go te pleices evary sprlng. W. bave net overcome the evil in- fluences of Jack Frost. Nor bava we learned the art o! continuons repair. The Commission wbîch re- perted last weak a*ivlsas an expenditure ln Ontario of tblrty million dollars lu fliteen Years, under a Central Higbways departmant. The advice la ex- cellent, but the mathod ef building is the thing. If new metbeds are net adopted, the money would ha wasted. Tariffs and Prosperity ALOT of nonsense is talkad about tariffs and prosparity. Canada had a few changes muade In ber tariff iast waek, and. ganerai business is net affeeted oe way or the ether. Last year, the United States made soe radical changea ln lts tariff, and business was net vislbly affectad favour-. ably or otherwiue. During the flrat feur uionths of the new U. S. tariff thera was an Inereasa o! six par cent. lu manufactures Imperted sud twenty per cent. in foodstuifs. There bave beau ne reai changes in the prices of elther class of goods. Indeéd, the cost of living bas gone Up instead of down. One would think, perhaps, that the free Importation o! beef Into the United States would have lowered prices. The supply increased, but the price kept up. It was easier to get beef-that was ail. No person was ln a position to bring in beef from Can- ada and Argentina lu large quantities except the Beef Trust, and they distributed the supply wlth great wlsdom. Most of the Argentina, bec!, indced, came from the Bec! Trust's own plant lu that country. Putting a tariff up or cutting a tariff down dosa not affect general business vcry much. The quan- tities of auything that eau be imported are usually such a small portion o! the whole trade that an iu- crease makes lIttle dIfference. A cut of five per cent. in cvery item in the Canadian tariff would benefit the consumer llttle, and au increase o! five per cent. would not affect hlm greatly. This talk about disaster overtaklng us If the tariff wcrc lowered la nonsense; and so is the talk about the great benefit which would come to us by the same action. The trade o! the country depends on many causes and conditions, and the tariff ls only a minor one o! a large uumber. What Canada needs cvery year, and what Canada TO MAINTAIN OUR HONOUR.

Youms trnly, REV. J. W. McMILLAN. The Grosse Isle Elevator and Mr. Corbett Winnipeg, Marcb 21, 1914. Editor Canadlan Courier: Sir-In looking through your Issue of Marcb l4th, we notice an article among your editorials entltied \"Grain Growers' Morale,\"1 wbicb apparently le a text for an attack on aur Company, supported by a letter fram H. S. Corbett, o! Grosse Isle, Manitoba. Ia Mm. Cerbett's letter be charges aur Company wlth givlng hlm a raw deai. The facte of the trans- action la the purcbase of wbeat from hlm, are as follows: Ho came te, our elevator and stated te our aporator tbere tbat bie had a car-load o! wbeat, te seli. He started te draw bis wbeat la on tbe 27tb o! Sep- tomber, and an tbe ROth of September ho stated te theoepematar that ho did not have a car-load and that 'lie wisbod te soîl by the waggea load, and on that date ho soid us bis wheat- On that day- No. 2 northem wbeat la store at P'ort William was 81%c. Tbe freigbt from Grasse Isle te Fort William le 7.2c. The elevator charges are 1%c. per bushel, wbicb weuld bave te be pald before the wbeat conld be placed la a car an the tf'acks, thus leaving the track 'price an car lots fer No. 2 nartbem wbeat at Grosse Isle that date 711/c. per buebel. Our joperator paid Mm. Cerbett 67c. per bushel, wbich was a spread of 4%c. between Street and track prîce on that day, and net 8e., as Mm. Cerbett falsely states. In paying this price we bad te take the ebance e! It grading No. 2 nartbomn, should It grade lower we wouid bave te sell at the prîce af the next lowest grade. Ia regard te the fias deal whieh Mr. Corbett re- fere te, hoe states that ho wae offe red by our agent that day 26e. below the market price. This la on- tlrely faiso. Ho did net even ask for a prico. Ho brought bis sample o! fiax te our eperator, wbo stated that bie would send it te us and bave It tested la the Govemament Inspectien Office bore. This sample came !orward la due course and wae graded by the Goverament officiais la tbe Inspection De- partment as \"rejeeted fias on account o! the large portion e! faise fias seede la the sample,\" and our adviee te our operator was te effer Mr. Carbett 92e. fer thie fias, wblch our aperator declares he did. No. 3 C. W. fiax that day, Nevember 4th, was $1 per bushel. The frelght ta Fort William from Grosse Ilie an fias le 8.2e., and the elevator charges 1%4c. per bushel, thus maklng the cash pnice o! fias at Grosse Ilie on that day 91V4c. la offerIng this price we were taklng the risk a! re-cleaning the flax and havIng it go as No. 3 C. W. Mr. Corbett did net acoept the pries, and hoe filled up ene load from the elevator, brought It te Winnipeg and uoid It te omre linseed company, where hie states he received No. 1 N. W. price, and afterwards came back, took the balance and dispoeed of It In the samne way. We believe that your object In publisbing Mr. Corbett's letter was to try to show that our Company was making an undue profit out of the farmers. We might state for your Information that we have mun the Grosse Isle elevator at a consIderable loss each year since we have operated IL. This fact can be verified, If necessary, thus disproving the point wbich you are trying to make in your attack on our Company. We can, however, assure you tbat Mr. Corbett's views ln regard to our Company are not generally held by the farmers of the West, as we have bad a very large number of requests from districts to, build elevators and operate tbem. on bebaîf o! the farmers. Mr. Corbett wmote a letter to the Winnipeg Tele- gram stating that hie was not a member af the Grain Growers' Association, and quoting the samne grievance as appears In your paper, with the excep- tion that hoe stated la that letter that wheat was wortb 81c., whereas la. his letter to you he states that it was wortb 82c. We are quite ready to admit that every farmer In the West Is not a supporter of our Company. A number prefer to, stay outslde the organization and 'teap the benefits In an indirect way. Not'wItbstand- ing the opposition a! unreasonable men lke Mr. Corbett, and those of bis clase, we can assure you that ou r business is steadily growIng, and shows a marked Improvemient eacb yeam over the previons one. We tbank you for the space occupled. Youro truly, THE GRAIN GROWERS' GRAIN CO., LTD. W. Moffat, Secretary. \"Oh, Damn It Ail! This Won't Do\" Toronto, April 4tb. 1914. Editor Canadian Conrier: Sir,-It has been said, and I think truly, that Eng- land ls now engaged ln the consoling occupation of assimilatIng ber bistory; that, burying ber august nose ia the glorious pages she bas written la tbe book o! buman endeavour, she doos not observe tb e changes that are taking place la bier internai economy. The detacbed habit of mInd whIcb Is a peculiarity of the Engiisb character, le a !act suffi- cîently notorlous. Wbat ls not a subject o! sucb general remark, bowever, ls that this national trait did net begla to manlfest ltseif until towards' tbe middle of tbe Victomian ema. Our grosa feediag, port- drlnklag, pock-marked ancestors were most emlnently not of detacbed habit of mind. The people who entered with sncb larity upon the War o! Jenkln's Ear, and bequeatbed a tendency to gout to their degenerate posterity, couid by no means be accused a! sncb a vice. The type of man wbo, In tbose days, ran bis man tbrougb tbe vitals, and then complained languldly that sucb violent exertions gave hlm the megrIns, 1s witb us to-day, but wltb a difference. He looks round upon tbe niverse wltb tbe air of one at a circus, wbo demande to be amused, and wbo, after gazing soiemnly at the anties ef the clown ln tbe ring, says, bltterly, \"fWby the devil don't yon make me laugh?\" He observes Parliament witb tbe same sorrowfui reproacb, tbougb tbere bave been limes wben, that staid assembly bave risen nobly to the occasion; wild nlghts when excited HI-bernian logis- lators In tomn ralmient bave been carried, out by stolid Saxon policemen, ather Hibernians Standing on tbe bencbes to cheer the glaonos spectacle. These, bowever, were merely flashes la the wilder- nees of Stygian duinees.' Our modern Englishman bas butene demand to make from life, \"Make me iaugh.\"R This acconts for tbe otberwise Inexplicable fact that while England le on the extreme edge o! the most appalling precîpice ebe bas faced sînce the daye of Cromwel--civil war staring ber In the face, Sans Culottes demanding lmperionsly te be breecbed, sedition on one baad, generai strikes on the otber,- army officers refusing duty, India seethIng with re- volt-while ail this le goiag on, what le aur English- man doing? Wbat le tbe question tbat le agitating hie mind?-for bie stiil bas a mmid, thîs Englishman. It ls this, \"What's golng to wln the Derby?\" The \"F'ianneled Fools\" are not ail dead yet, Mr. Kipling. The only sentiment hoe alewe himsef te entertain apart from sucb, le te reprobate, ln as Icolent a manner as hie energy will permit, Mr. Lloyd George, and ail bis eangulnnry doings. If we ceuid ensure a succession of Lloyd Georges we mlght hope te arouse our frîend to somethlng approaching interest In the things which. are happening round him, but the day of miracles is past. The Boer War aroused some of themn to go out and get themselves shot; but not, observe, until hie had had some particularly nasty slaps in the face, whereupon hie gazed ai ound In a perfectly astonished manner, and exciaimed, \"Eh! What! Bulier beaten? Methuen beaten? Gatacre beaten? Oh, damn it ail, this won't do!\" and havlng proved, witb much pain and tribulation, that it wouid flot do, he resumed, with great satisfaction, his former engrossing occu- pations-those of hinm who survived. It might be supposed that such an individuai must possess, to put it as charitably as possible, a some- what vacant mmnd. Sncb, however, ls not the case; better if it were; for whea one has performed the pre- liinary task of sweeping and dusting an empty room, one may put some furniture into It, a desk to work at, as weli as easy-chairs in wihicb to repose; but when the chamber ls already fiiled with rubbIsb, amongst which the moths and worms are busily engaged, and to, wbich the owner clings witb pas- elonate affection, one can only hope for a fire or an earthquake, praying that the owner bimself may not be buried In the ruins. If notbing short of a catastrophe wIll, do the busi- ness. and as this friend of ours stili possesses, be- neath a somewbat fisb-lke exterior, many of the qualities which made those \"Itwo smaîl Islands off the coast o! France\" o! such Importance on'this plaffet, let us hope the primai stroke may not bie long deiayed. At this most critical moment of English bistory, the deadly apathy witb which the typical Englishmian regards bimef, may sug \u003egest to, some minds that hie knows himseif to be played eut. This, bowever, wouid be a fatal mistake for, say, Germany, to make For somne misguided power to attempt to take ad- vantage o! hier internai throes would be the savlng o! the situation, for when our friend lifts bis eyes fromn the raclng calendar and says, \"Oh, I say, this won't do!\" depend upon It, it xnost emphatically won't do.

FEMAGNATED59 British Sentiment PRMINENT Conservative, mamber of Parliament told a Toronto audience tý\\ reently that Canada should support the British navy ýbecause British investors have loaned Canadians a billion dollars, meaning theraby a thousand million. According to his -argument, the British people lent us money becaiise we were poor relatives and needed assistance, flot bacause they thought the lnvestments were sound. If this la trua, then the sooner the practice is changed, the bettar for alli concernad. To lend Canada money on such a basis is simply to encourage \"lbad business.\" It will benafit naither Canada nor Great Britain. Whenevar the British people lend to Canadians on a \"famiîy\" basis, they are committîng a crime against their neady relatives. On the other hand, if the British ln- vestor will lend us money, only when our proposed ventures are raasonably sound, they will keep us from going into, games that are rottan. The greatast kindness that can be dctne to Canada by the British investor is to send monay over hare on the same basis as they would send It to the United States or Argentina. The Empire cannot be bult Up by puttlng money into doubtful ventures. Canada must be kept financially sound, or Its success will be lmpadad. The British capitallat who sends us money on \"sentiment\" only la doing us Incal- culable harm. If titis reasoning is sound, then Canada owes Great Britain. thanka only for sucit investments as have been made here on the same basis as lnvestments elsewhere. Canada owes Great Britain nothlng for the unwîse, sentimental squandering of her capital on boomsters who have talked \"Imperiai unity\" and ,sold \"wild-cats\" to gullible Imperiallsts In Great Britain.

The annauncement af tie reductioil by4Vhe Canadian Railwnys Commissioners onuscd an Immediate drap of six or seven points la C.P.R., and had a similar effect on G.T.R. quotations la London.

Probably tic railways will flnd it nccssary ta reduce Western wages sligitly, as hitherto these have been coasiderably Iligier than wages ln Vhe East. What cffect Vhe reduction la rates wlll have on railway extension la tic West remains ta be seen.

The Women's Civic League of Win- nipeg recently held a special meeting to, discuss the advisability of runnlng a woman candidate for school trustee in Ward Three, a post which the death of its occupant left vacant. A new book, \"Wheat and Woman,\" the author of which, Miss Georgina Binnie-Clarit, is well-known both ln Canada and England, gîves a graphic picture of life in the West when the settler is alone and is a woman.

P LAYER folk, durlug leisure hours, usually sleep or eat. Yes, and sometimes, they answer their mail or go out for a walk.

That la, usually Now comes the exception. The lîttle group who are lncluded under the Laureuce Irving Company beadiues are different. It may be because they are Euglish. For they- fIud the distances very. great here Iu Canada, aud naturally, try to occupy thetuselves when they are skImming over these distances lu a Pullman coacli. Tliey bave orgauis'ed a magazine club. Whlch la to, say that ecd o! the dozea principal members o! the player !amily buys a magazine every month, and s0 arranges that that magazine will g o the rounds o! ail the group. Tlie whole thing is very systematlc. Oh, extremely systematie, for players. For'eue usually thinka of player folk belng se, overburdened wltli tempera- ment, that elusive someting wich la mxade tie excuse for ail kinds cf ec- ýcentricities, that any klnd o! system must needa boecrased from their dally catalogue. On tic back of ecd magazine is printed a Ilat o! dates, with a player's name opposite ecd. So tic books go tie rounds, ffllng up the days o! the month wlth-more orý lesa frivolous- readlng. Eaci person la aliowcd the prî vilege of kecplng tiem two days, thus havlng plenty of tîme to deter. mine what te rcad and what flot to. The only dlfficulty whici arises le the difference Iu tastes. For cxa.mple, Miss Cjompton once liad thc desîre to learn what were tic prevalling fasi- ions lu Amerîca. Thcy have been eut licre only a moutli. So sic bought a Ladies' Home Journal. The Illustra- tions proved Interasting enough, for a whlle. Tien sic passed the book on te the next person on the it. So on, down the Une, tîli It came to Mrs . Frost, tic wl!e o! the manager.

It was Mr. Neville, the poet lu 'Typhoon.\" ,Now, Mr. Neville dees not suggesi. the above-mentioned magazine in any way. As a matter of tact, moat of hiýi reading consists o! books which have a peculiarly masculine tang. He looked at the magazine. For a mo- ment lis silence was even more' ominous than any.outburst. Then lie said, very quietly, \"Why dldn't you hand me 'Weldon's Fashion. Journal'? I mucli prefer the styles lu that.\" Mrs. Frost hoped for better things, the next time. But alas, someone else had had a yearning for feminine frip- pery, too. The next bookt to, faîl to her was The Lady's Realm. She was in despair. But she handed it on to Mr. Neville ln true heroism, and made a hasty exit before she could catch any crumýb of comment. At the end of the month, ail the read and re-read magazines are sent to some charitable institution, for there are usually enougli dîfferent kinds to suit ail tastes. A !ew of the compauy have Inter- ests other than the magarine club. Interests which make their dayýs go quickly. Mrs. Irving is one of these. Otherwise, Mabel Hackney. She looks after ail her distinguished husband's correspondence, sees that his truuks are packed, and ail such vexatioua trivialities of travelling. And there are two women who spend their days makiug clothes for wee people to wear. Tiny t.ota away ýacrosa the Atlantic. One o! these is Viola Compton, who in real life la Mrs. Henry Crocker.

It was only by a flrm effort of will hie kept his mind fixed upon the steering wheel, and brought the car safely back to the Maisonette in time for luncheon. The boy ln buttons ran down the steps and carried in the parcels. \"Dinner's ready,\" he grinned. \"An' if you want any grub you'd better be spry.\"1 With a nod, John Grey turned the car towards the mews., He would rather have had his meals with the Smillles, and feit a strong disllke to the present arrangemlent, as hie sauntered back to the' servants' quar- ters. B ELLA, the smnart parlour-maid, was a decided flirt. Phebe, the house-mald, supposed to be en- gaged-was open to further offers; while Mrs. Law, the cook, a stout lady bordering on flfty, stated plainlY that she was not averse to another trial of the matrimonial yoke, she be- ing a 1'lone widder.\" The boy in buttons was not a for- midable rival. The females regarded John Grey as their legitimate prey. There was a warmn outlook before himu which it would require the dip- lomnacy of a Secretary of State to win through, and at the samne timie keep the peace and bis liberty intact. Loaded with flattering attentions, and open compliments, the new chauf- feur was forthwIth placed in a deli- cate position that required great tact and caution. There was no false modesty on the Part of the ladies in the matter o!f 'seeking information respecting is past life and previons places. He drew largely on a vivid imagination to satisfy these feminine cravings, but the position, full of danger, Irri- tated hlm. John Grey was soon made familiar with the family hlstory o! the Praggs.. Bella, Phebe andi Mrs. Law each gave. ber own version. Thus hie learneti that Lady Assitas was 'Miss Pragg's miarried sîster, and liveti at Stone Hall in Kep~t, when she was not at her town house In ýCurzon Street. \"Sixteen servants, 1 'ears they keeps at Stone 'AIl,\" said Bella, ira- Presolvely. 1 You can't believe ail youà 'ears, Bella,\" sald Mrs. Law bridllng. \"Mr. Smith told me hisself, lie Ouglit to know,\" retorted Bella. \"Qulte the gentleman is Mr. Smith, he's 'er ladyshlp's shooffer. You rnlght like to know 'lm,\" observed Bella, turning to John Grey. 'ýDellghted,\" he marmured polltely. \"I dDn't know as I'd trust that man too far, Bella,\" warned Mrs. Law darkly.' \"For why, pray?\" asked Bella. \"I May 'ave my reasons, or I may not,\" replled the cook mysteri1ously. Bella tossed ber head and snlffed. nLady Assitas bas three daughters, a.1' MISS Peggy le; the youngest,\" ob- 8er'ved Mrs. Law by way of changlng the subJect. \"An' Bhe aln't too young,\" remarked Bella pertîy. \"She won't see twenty4Ive no lnore,\" giggled Phebe. \"Lady Assitas can't abide 'er ne.- ther,\" proclu.lmed Mrs. Law aut.horl- tatlvely: \"she's aIl for the other two %*Ot's marrled tities, they doue welI for thersel's,\" she added lmpretislvely, ad she helped herself to pickles. \"'Enery paso that there beer!

What More Than Men Get in No-Rim-Cut Tires -the Most Popular Tires in the World? Many tires -particularly anti-skids- are sold at advances Up to 30 per cent over Good- year prices. How do makers justify those vastly higher prices ? What Do They Say? Do they claim that they have an anti-skid better than our double-thick All-WVeather tread? If so, won't you make a comparison? Do they claim greater mileage? If SQ, how have Goodyears, in the test of time, be- corne the most popular tires in the world ? Do they dlaim better features? Note that the four grçatest features used in tires today are found in Goodyears only. Costhest to Make The fact is that Good- years are the costliest tires to make. But we save by added output and efficiency. \u003e They are the only tires which have AlI-Weatber treads, or any anti-skid device which compares with thexu. The Limiit in Low Cost Per Mile No man knows of any way to lower our cost per mile. And, in ail probability, nobody ever will. At Akron we spend $100,000 yearly on researchi and experiment. At our Bowman- ville factory, where Canadian Goodyears are made, we employ the samne scientific methods. 13ut we haven't in years found a single way to better formula. or fabric ma- terially. On a value basis, No- Rim-Cut tires should be the higbest-priced tires in Canada. But now you eau get Goodyear AIl- Weather anti-skid treads for less than most others. They can't be rim-cut. And no other makerdoes what we do to save blow- outs and loose treads. A higher price mens simply higher profit. Else it means small out- put or inefficiency. You cannot w*ish to pay for things like that. THE GOODYEAR TIRE \u0026 RUBBER COMPANY 0F CANADA, LIMITErD Head Office, Toronto COUNT THE PLEASURES that come witb the ownership of a cone.

Lt was, of course, anticipated that there would be some loss by way of debenture discounts, and therefore certain addltional annual charges arising therefrom, but the actual amount incurred is far beyond anything theii contemplated. In the third place, it was flot anticipated when the report was issued a year ago that the Commission would be called upon to assume the retroactive sinlî- ing fund obligations attached to the debenture issues ütherwise than by equal annual loadings for the remaining debenture term. Lt has, liowever, :become necessary to assume them in full, with the resuit that future surpluses have been thereby mortgageci in favor of the sinkinýg fund obligations to the~ amount of $94;G17.20. The burden, therefore, im- posed upon the System lby the necessity of estaL\u0026 Ilshing a Steam Reserve Plant; by the aclcltionau, sînklng fund obligations in question, and the neces- sity o! utilizing the whole of the resources of the System for the payment of current liabilities pending arrangements for a sufficlent amount of working capital, combine to make a reduction of rates at the' present time impossible. Lt is due to the public that thase conditions be clearly stated, because very un- fortuýnately an impression lias recently been sown inl the public mind that a reduction of rates is immi- nent., The rates enjoyed by the customýers of the Hydro-Electric System are .understood to be lower than rates of like service ln, any, city on the Con- tinent of this size. No. complaint lias, -as far as youi Commissioners are aware, been voiced against these rates by the consumers of tb.e System. Wlîenever the conditions warrant it, the rates will be lowered, but it would be a -breacli of trust on the part of. your 'Commissioners to sanction any reduction thereof before the financial. condition.of the Enterprise justi- fies It. Lt la the policy of your Commissioners to, give, ln the fIrst place, a first-class service, and iii the second place, to give that service at the lowes-. cost possible. That policy will be firmly adhered to. SALE 0F DEBENTURES: In view of the statements tliat bave been, publicly made to the effoct that your Commissioners are re- sponstbie for the heavy debenture bass, Lt la neces- sary to point out that the Commission had nothing whatever to do with the sale of these debentures. They were sold dlrectly by the Corporation of the City o! Toronto. Lt Is, la the judgment o! your Coin- mîssioners, very unfortunate that the debentures authorlzed under By-laws Nos. 5036 and '6918, aggre- gating $4,950,000, were not sold earller, when the market for municipal deibentures was much more favorable. The first-mentloned by-law was passed in January, 1908, and the second in January, 1912, but the debentures were not sold untIl the middle of 1913, wlien the conditions of clvlc finance and the state of the money market combined to render a sale compulsory. The prices ýrealized were probably sat- isfactory in view of the then state of the market and the history of the previons financing attempted. But the quoted prices ex-dividend on the Londlon Stock Exchange between July, 1910, and July, 1912, of four per cent. City of Toronto debentures, due 1944-1948, ranged from 101 to 103 at the first-mentioned date to 96 f0o 98 at the last-mentioned date. Had these two items been sold within the period named, they would have probably reali, ed minimum prices of frum 92 to 96, givlng a safe average of, say, 94. Tho resultant saving would have been about 12 per cent., or $594,000. In the judgment of your Commissioners, aIl Hydro-Electric debentures should be marketed by themselves. CIVIC ELECTRIC SERVICES: In connection with the proposed extensions to the Civlc Waterworks System, attention Is drawn to the importance f0 the Hydro-Electric System of the Waterworks Department utilizing electric power ln the fullest possible degree. The Corporation lias invested a large amount of capital in this System, which was established on fthe faith and covenant o! a complete monopoly of the civic electric services. The supply of electric power to the Waterworks De- partment for ail purposes there-of during off-pealï hours will have an Important Influence in reducing the ail-round cost, and, therefore, in bringing tiR lime nearer at which rates may be reduced. It ls also worth while noting, in conneetion with street light-ý ing cost, that the street lighting system now repre- sents a connected load of 5,600 h.p., against an esti- mated load of 666 h.p. at the inception of the enter- prise, and, as already stated, 520 miles of streets are now lighted, against 280 miles at the time aforesaid. The extra cost the municipallty is now under for street lighting is due, therefore, to the extra service given, the rates being the lowest ln the history o! the cify. AUDITORS' REPORT: The matters referred f0 by the Auditors in para- graph four of their report are in process of adjust- ment. This is a relic of the unsatisfactory condi- tions originating in the regime of the former man- agement. The matters referred to in paragraph five o! the samne report will be settled with the Corpora- tion of the City of Toronto during the present year. CONCLUSION: The progress of the past, and the promise of the future, amply vindicate the public confidence placed ln the enterprise, and for the many continuing proof8 of that confidence your Commissioners are deeply grafeful.

         "CANADIAN COURIER. \" Love and the Universe \" When Dr. Albert D. Watson put lisbed his \"Wing of the Wild Bird,' critics discovered a new note in Cana dian poetry. There was a liling lyric ism that was purest melody. The issu nnce of his \"Love and the Universe' (Macmillan) scarcely bears out th( promise of that earlier volume, ye there is much in these later poems t( constitute the offering of one of th( finest contributions of the year. Ai unerrýing sense of poetic rhythm, ï chastely classical diction, combinet with a studied and careful expression that is yet devoid o! any hint o! arti ficiality, make of the passages wherý ho sings for the pure love o! singinî his supreme achievement-an absolutE lyricism. The title poem, highly dignified, hE marred to some extent by an uneven ness, not in form, for Dr. Watson Could not err in the technicaltties ol construction, but in thought. Several stan7as o! high imaginative beauty, and structural perfection are spoiled bY a, banal line that detracts from its effectiveness. My space is too limited to quote as I would wish to quote, but there is such sheer beauty o! concep- tion In the followlng stanza, it empha- szsso well the colourful qualities o! the verse, that ýI cannot but quote it: \"The voiceless symphony o! moor and highland, The 'rainbow on the mlst, The white moon-sbield above tihe slumber-Island, The mirror-lake, star-kissed, The life o! budding lea! and spray and branches, The dew upon the sod, The roar o! downward-rusbing aval- anches, Are eloquent o! God.\" But It la in the lyrica that abonnd in the book that Dr. Watson's power is most evident, although bis sonnets are cbaracterixed witb a nobility of thouglit and bigh sustained dignity that maire them most praiseworthy. The making o! music is to the writer a pleasurable pastime, and there are !ew, if any, Canadian writers who caii achieve a more purely lyrical effect. The series of monologues cafled \"The Immortals\" sbow remarkable insight into the lives and individualities of the great men he has sought to inter- pret. jif a mere reviewer may say so, how- ever, the most noteworthy portion o! the voluirse Is the !oreword by Kath- arine Hale, exquisite In conception. and noble In achlevement, although 1 cannot quite agree with lier estimate o! Dr. Watson. English Opinion on a Canadian Choir T HIS la what the London \"Musical Herald\" has to say about the 1915 visit o! the Mvendelssohn Choir to Englanti a year from next June: \"The Toronto Municipal Board o£ Control decided to vote £2,0OO as a grant to the Mendelssohn Choir to help finance the proposed European tnip of 1915. Already about £5,000 la assureti for the guarantee fund by frientis o! the Choir, so that there la a little more than haîf the amount sQtili to be raised. It Is probable that the Ontario and Federal Governments wlll do their ahare, as the appearance o! the Choir In England, France and Germany would have an lncalculably fine effect botb as an artlstlc and Comn- mnercial advertisement. The visit will require six weeks.\"' At the present tinte considerably more than the amount Indicated by the \"H-erald\" bas been ralsed. There are stilI several thousanti dollars to find to complote the $75,OO0 necessary. The Choir are aiready holding weekly rehearsals on the programmes for the Buropean concerts. Ail but less than ten o! the 235 members are able to go on the trip. Thre ltlnerary is expected to cover most o! the music centres of Englanti anti soins on the continent. Before aaillng the Choir will probably give one concert la Montreal, andi one la Newv York w,ýith thre Philhrarmonie Orchestra. Boston trieti to get thein, but wlthout resuit. That Is jii5t as Well. It mlight have been as 'well if thre Choir had cut out the New York con- cert at this time. _______ 57___5__________ n_7_ 7 wlYl7 1 PR y ISITING CARDS-Ladies' or Gentle- men's prlntedl to order-lateat styles; tlfty cents per hundred, post-paid.
