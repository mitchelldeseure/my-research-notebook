CHAPTER I \" THK DRUSES AKE UP I\" \" GMtAT Scott, look at her I She's goin' to try and take em! exclaimed Osterhaut, the Jack-ol-aU-trades at Lebanon. \" She ain't such a fool as aU that.

         "well \" THE DRUSES ARE UP !\" 7 done, Miw Druse I Well done, I say— well done I\" ex-claimed Jowett, dancing about and waving his arms to-wards the adventurous girl. The girl had reached the angry, thrashing waters where the rocks rent and tore into white ribbons the onnishing current, and her first trial had come on the instant the spitting, raging panthers oi foam struck the bow o( her canoe. The waters were so low that this course, which she had made once before with her friend Tekewani the Blackfeet chief, had perils not met on that desperate journey. Her canoe struck a rock slantwise, shuddered and swung ound, but by a dexterous stroke she freed the frail craft. It righted and plunged forward again into fresh death-traps. It was these new dangers which had made Tekewani try to warn her from the shore — ^he and the dozen braves with him: but it was characteristic of his race that, after the first warning, when she must play out the game to the bitter end, he made no farther attempt to stop her. The Indians ran down the river-bank, however, with eyes intent on her headlong progress, grunting approval as she plunged safely from danger to danger. Osterhaut and Jowett became silent, too, and, like the Indians, ran as fast as they coulU, over fences, through the trees, : tumbling and occasionally cursing, but watching with fascinated eyes this adventuress of the North, taking chances which not one coureur-de-bois or river-driver iu a thousand would take, with a five thousand-dollar prize as the lure. Why should she do it ? \" Women folks are sich dam fools when they git goin',\" gasped Osterhaut as he ran. \" They don't care a split pea what happens when they've got the pip. Look at her — my hair's bleacbin' \" \" She's got the pip all right,\" stuttered Jowett as he plunged I ■ they'i Igoti pip, foreign men and women both — ^but the women go",

How should she know ? Wherefore should she know ? This was of the things beyond the why of the human nund. Sometimes aU our Uves, if we keep our souU young, and see the world as we first saw it with eyes Md heart unsoiled, we hear the murmuring of the Other Self, that Self from which we separated when we entered this mortal sphere, but which followed us, invisible yet whispermg uispu-ation to us. But sometimes we only hear It, our own soul's oracle, while yet our years are few, and we have not passed that frontier between inno-cence and experience, reahty and pretence. Pretence it IS which drives the Other Self away with waiUng on its lips. Then we hear It cry in the night when, because of the trouble of life, we cannot sleep; or at the play when we are caught away from ourselves into another air than ours; when music pours around us Ijke a softli^d from a garden of pomegranates; or when a chUd asks a question which bnngs us back to the land where everything is so true that it can be shouted from the tree-tops. Why was Fleda Druse tempting death in the Carillon Rapids ? She had heard a whisper as she wandered among *he pme-trees there at Manitou, and it said simply the one word, '• Now I\" She knew that she must do it; she had driven her canoe out into the resistless current to ride the Rapids of CariUon. Her Other Self had whispered to her. Yrader, thousands of miles away in Syria, there were the mils of Lebanon; and there was one phrase which made every Syrian heart beat faster, if he were on the march. It was, \" The Druses are up ! \" When that wild tnbe took to the saddle to war upon the Caravans and agamst authority, from Lebanon to Pahnyra,",
         "from 10 THE WORLD FOR SALE Jerusalem to Damascus men looked anxiously about them and rode hard to refuge. And here also in the Far North where the River Sagalac ran a wUd race to Carillon, leaving behind the new towns of Lebanon and Manitou, \" the Druses were up.\" The daughter of Gabriel Druse, the giant, was riding the Rapids of the Sagalac. The suspense to her and to those who watched her course— to Tekewani and his braves, to Osterhaut and Jowett— could roi be long. It was a matter of minutes only, in which every second was a miracle and might be a catastrophe. From rock to rock, from wild white water to wild white water she sped, now tossing to death as it seemed, now shooting on safely to the next test of skill and courage —on, on, till at last there was only one passage to make before the canoe would plunge into the smooth water ninnmg with great swiftness till it ahnost reached Carillon. Suddenly, as she neared the last dangerous point, round which she must swing between jagged and unseen barriers of rock, her sight became for an instant dimmed, as though a cloud passed over her eyes. She had never fainted in her life, but it seemed to hei now that she was hovering on unconsciousness. Commending the will and energy left, she fought the weakness down. It was as though she forced a way through tossing, buffeting shadows; as though she was shaking ofi from her shoulders shadowy lands which sought to detain her; as though smothering thmgs kept choking back her breath, and darkness like clouds of wool gathered about her face. She was fighting for her life, and for years it seemed to be; though indeed It was only seconds before her wiU reasserted itself, and hght broke again upon her way. Even on the verge of the last ambushed passage her senses came back; but they came with a stark realization of the peril ahead: it looked out of her eyes as a face shows itself at the window of a burning",
         "building. \" THE DRUSES ARE UP I\" u Memory shook itself free. It pieiced the tumult of waters, found the ambushed rocks, and guided the lithe brown arms and hands, so that the swift paddle drove the canoe straight onward, as a fish drives itself through a flume of dragon's teeth beneath the flood. The canoe quivered for an instant at the last cataract, then respond-ing to Memory and Will, sped throu:h the hidden chasm, tossed by spray and water, and swept into the swift cur-rent of smooth w_ er below. Fleda Druse had run the Rapids of Carillon. She could hear the bells ringing for evening service in the Catholic Church of Carillon, and beUs— soft, booming bells— were ringing in her own brain. Like muffled silver these brain-bells were, and she was as one who enters into a deep forest, and hears far away in the boscage the mystic summons of forest deities. Voices from the banks of the river behind called to her— hilarious, approving, agitated voices of her Indian friends, and of Osterhaut and Jowett, those wild spectators of her adventure; but they were not wholly real. Only those soft, booming bells in her brain were real. Shooting the Rapids of Carillon was the bridge by which she passed from the world she had left to this other. Her girlhood was ended— wondering, hovering, unreaUzing girlhood. This adventure was the outward sign, the rite in the Lodge of Life which passed her from one degree of being to another. She was safe; but now as her canoe shot onward to the town of Carillon, her senses again grew faint. Again she felt the bufieting mist, again her face was muffled in smothering folds; again great hands reached out towards her ; again her eyes were drawn into a stupefying darkness ; but now there was no will to fight, no energy to resist! The paddle lay inert in her fingers, her head drooped! She slowly raised her head once, twice, as though",
         "the 12 THE WORLD FOR SALE call of the exhausted will was hearf, but suddenly it fell heavdy upon her breast. For a moment so, a£d then as the canoe shot forward on a fresh current, the lithe body sank backwards in the canoe, and lay face upward to the evemng sky.

Men said he had bitten off more than he could chew, but he had rephed that his teeth were good, and he would masti-cate the meal or know the reason why. He was only thirty- three, but his will was Uke nothing the West had seen as yet. Xt was sublime in its confidence, it was free from conceit, Md it knew not the word despair, though once or twice It had known defeat. Men cheered him from the shore as his skiff leaped throu^ the water. \" It's that blessed Ingolby,\" sdd Jowett, who had tried to \" do \" the financier in a horse- dea., and had been done instead, and was now a devout adinirer and idherent of the Master Man. \" I saw him dnvmg down there this morning from Lebanon. He's been fishing at Seely's Eddy.\" \" When Ingolby goes fishing, there's trouble goin' on somewhere and he's stalkin' it,\" rejoined Osterhaut. But, by gol, he s goin' to do this trump trick first • he's goin to overhaul her before she gits to the i -idee. Look at hm swing! Hell, ain't it pretty I There you go, old Ingolby You re right on it, even when you're fidiing.\" On the other-the Manitou-shore Tekewani and his braves were less talkative, but they were more",
         "con- 14 THE WORLD FOR SALE cwned in the incident than Osterhaut and Jowett. They taew little or nothing of Ingolby the hustlrr, but they knew more of Fleda Druse and her father than all the people of Lebanon and Manitou put together. Fleda had won old Tekewani's heart when she had asked him to take her down the Rapids, for the days of adventure for him and his tribe were over. The adventure shared wrth this girl had brought back to the chief the old days when Indian women tanned bearskins and deerskins day in, day out, and made pemmican of the bufialo-meat ; when the years were filled with hunting and war and migrant joumeyings to fresh game-grounds and pastures Danger faced was the one thing which could restore Tekewani's self-respect, after he had been checked and rebuked before his tribe by the Indian Commissioner for b«ng drunk. Danger faced had restored it, and Fleda Druse had brought the danger to him as a gift. If the canoe should crash against the piers of the bridge. If It should drift to the cataract below, if anything should happen to this white girl whom he worshipped in his heathen way, nothing could preserve his self-respect j he would pour ashes on his head and fire-water down his throat. Suddenly he and his braves stood still. They watched as one would watch an enemy a hundred times stronger than ones self. Tha white man's skiii was near the derelict canoe; the bridge was near also. Carillon now hned the bank of the river with its people. They ran upon the bridge, but not so fast as to reach the place where, m the nick of time, Ingolby got possession of the rolhng canoe; where Fleda Druse lay waiting like a prin-cess to be waked by the kiss of destiny. Only five hundred yards below the bridge was the second cataract, and she would never have waked if she had been carried into",
         "it. \" THE DRUSES ARE VP !\" W To Ingolby she was as beautiful as a human being could be as she lay with white face upturned, thu paddle still in hei hand. \" Drowning isn't good enough for her,\" he said, as he listened her canoe to his skifi. \" It's, been a full day's work,\" he added; and even in this human crisis he thought of the fish he had caught, of \" the big trouble,\" he had been thinking out as Osterhant had said, as well as of the girl that he was saving. \" I always have luck when I go fishing,\" he added presently. \" I can take her back to Lebanon,\" he con-tinued with a quickening look. \" She'll be all right in a jiffy. I've got room for her in my buggy— and room for her in any place that belongs to me,\" he hastened to reflect with a curious, bashful smile. \" It's like a thing in a book,\" he murmured, as he neared the waiting people on the banks of Carillon, and the ringing of the vesper bells came out to him on the evening air. \" Is she dead ?\" some one whispered, as eager hands reached out to secure his skiff to the bank. \" As dead as I am,\" he answered with a laugh, and drew Fleda's canoe up alongside his skiff. He had a strange sensation of new life, as, with delicacy and gentleness, he lifted her up in his strong arms and stepped",

It was, however tned sorely when Fleda came to consciousness again in lus arms and realized that a man's face was nearer to hers than any man's had ever been except that of her own father. Her eyes opened slowly, and for the instant she did not understand, but when she did, the blood stole swiftly back to her neck and face and forehead, and she started in dismay. \" Put me down,\" she whispered faintly. \" I'm taking you to my buggy, \" he replied. •\u003c I'll drive you back to Lebanon.\" He spoke as calmly as he could for there was a strange fluttering of his nerves, and the crowd was pressing him. \" Put me down at once,\" she said peremptorily. She trembled on her feet, and swayed, and would have fallen but that Ingolby and a woman in black, who had pushed her way through the crowd with white, anxious lace, caught her. \"Give her air, and stand back !\" called the sharp voice of the constable of Carillon, and he heaved the people back with his powerful shoulders. A space was cleared round the place where Fleda sat with her head against the shoulder of the stately woman m black who had come to her assistance. A dipper of water was brought, and when she had drunk it she raised her head slowly and her eyes sought those of Ingolby. One cannot pay for such things.\" she said to him",

Though deeply grateful, it was a trial beyond telling to be obliged to owe the debt of a life to any one, and in par-ticular to a man of the sort to whom material gifts could not be given. \" Such things are paid for just by accepting them, \" he answered quickly, trying to feel that he had never held her in his arms, as she evidently desired him to feel. He had intuition, if not enough of it, for the regions whei« the mind of Fleda Druse dwelt. \" I couldn't very well decline, could I ?\" she rejoined, quick humour shooting into her eyes. \" I was helpless. I never fainted before in my life.\" ^ \" I am sure you will never faint again,\" he remarked. \" We only do such things when we are very young.\" She was about to reply, but paused reflectively. Her half.opened lips did not frame the words she had been impelled to speak. Admiration was alive in his eyes. He had never seen this type of womanhood before— such energy and grace, so amply fft so lithely framed; such darkness and fairness in one living composition; such individuality, yet such intimate simplicity. Her hair was a very light brown, sweeping over a broad, low forehead, and lying, as though with a sense of modesty, on the tips of the ears, veiling them slightly. The forehead was classic in its intellectual fulness; but the skin was so iresh, even when pale as now, and with such an underglow of vitality, that the woman in her, sex and the possibilities of sex, cast a glamour over the intellect and temperament showing in every line of her contour. In contrast to the light brown of the hair was the very dark brown of the eyes and the still darker brown of the eyelashes. The face jhone, the eyes burned, and the piquancy of the contrast between the soft illumin-ating whiteness of the skin and the flame in the eyes had fascinated many more than Ingolby.",

These were sufficient to carry Wm through in three years, and there was enough profit- sharing from the drug-business he had founded on terms to shelter his mother and his younger brothers, while he took honours at the University. There he organized all that students organize, and was called in at last by the Bursar of his college to re-organize the commissariat, which he did with such success that the college saved five thousand dollars a year. He had genius, the college people said, and after he had taken his degre^ with honours in classics and mathematics they offered him a professorship at two thousand dollars a year. He laughed ironically, but yet with satisfaction, when the professorship was offered. It was all so different from what was m his mind for the future. As he looked out of the oriel window in the sweet gothic building, to the green grass and the maples and ehns which made the college grounds Uke an old-world park, he had a vision of himself permanently in these surroundings of refinement growing venerable with years, seeing pass under his influence thousands of young men directed, developed and inspired by him. He had, however, shaken himself free of this modest vision. He knew that such a life would act like a narcotic to his real individuality. He thirsted for contest, for the control of brain and will; he wanted to construct; he was filled with the idea of simplifying things, of economizing strength; he saw how futUe was much competition, and how the big brain could command and control with ease, wasting no force, saving labour, making the things controlled bigger and better. So it came that his face was seen no more in the oriel wmdow. With a mere handful of dollars, and some debts, he left the world of scholarship and superior pedagogy, and went where the head offices of railways were.

Its very monotony had its own individuahty. The Sagalac, even when mudrty had its own deep interest, and when it was full of logs drifting down to the saw-mills, for which he had found the money by interesting capitahsts in the East, he sniffed the stinging smell of the pines with elation. As the great saws in the mills, for which he had secured the capital, throwing off the spray of mangled wood, hummed and buzzed and sang his mouth twisted in the droll smile it always wore when he talked with such as Jowett and Osterhaut, whose idio-syncrasies were like a meal to him; as he described it once to some of the big men from the East who had been behmd his schemes, yet who cavilled at his ways. He was never diverted from his course by such men, and while he was loyal to whose who had backed him, he vowed that he would be independent of these wooden souls m the end. They and the great bankers behind them were for monopoly; he was for organization and for economic prudence. So far they were necessary to all he did; but it was his intention to shake himself free of aU monopoly in good time. One or two of his colleagues saw the dnft of his policy and would have thrown hun over if they could have replaced him by a man as capable, who would, at the time, consent to grow rich on their terms.

Unhke other towns of the West, it was insanitary and uneducated; it was also given to nepotism and a pnmitive kind of jobbery; but, on the whole, it was honest.

So it was that, to her father's dismay and joy in one, she had fled from school, leaving all her things behind her; and had reached home with only the clothes on her back and a few cents in her pocket.

         "^ W THE WORLD FOR SALE With sudden resolution Druse turned. Leaving the veranda, he walked slowly behind the house into the woods and stood still under the branches of a great cedar. Raising his head, a strange, solemn note came from his lips; but the voice died away in a sharp broken sound which was more human than birdlike, which had the shrill insistence of authority. The call to him had been almost ventriloquial in its nature. His lips had not moved at all. There was silence for a moment after he had called into the void, as it were, and then there appeared suddenly from behind a clump of juniper, a young man of dark face and upright bearing. He made a slow obeisance with a gesture suggestive of the Oriental world, yet not like the usual gesture of the East Indian, the Turk or the Persian; it was composite of all. He could not have been more than twenty-five years of age. He was so sparely made, and his face being clean-shaven, he looked even younger. His clothes were the clothes of the Western man; and yet there was a manner of wearing them, there were touches which were evidence to the watchful observer that he was of other spheres. His wide, felt. Western hat had a droop on one side and a broken treatment of the crown, which of itself was enough to show him a stranger to the prairie, while his brown velveteen jacket, held by its two lowest buttons, was reminiscent of an un-English life. His eyes alone would have announced him as of some foreign race, though he was like none of the foreigners who had been the pioneers of Manitou. Unlike as he and Gabriel Druse were in height, build, and movement, still there was something aldn in them both. After a short silence evidently disconcerting to him, \" Blessing and hail, my Ry,\" he said in a low tone. He spoke in a strange language and with a voice rougher than his looks would have",

He seemed to speak by rote. His manner was too eager to suit the irapressive- ness of his words. \" The sheep are without a shepherd,\" he said. \" The young men many among the Gorgios, or they are lost in the dties and return no more to the tents and the fields and the road. There is disorder in all the world among the Romanys. The ancient ways are for-gotten. Our people gather and settle upon the land and live as the Goigios live. They forget the way beneath the trees, they lose their skill in horses. If the fountain is choked, how shall the water run ?\" A cold sneer came to the face of Gabriel Druse. \" The way beneath the trees !\" he growled. \" The way of the open road is enough. The way beneath the trees is the way of the thief, and the skill of the horse is the skiU to cheat.\" There is no other way. It has been the way of the Romany since the time of Timur Beg and centuries beyond Timur, so it is toM. One man and ail men must do as the tribe has done since the beginning.\" The old man pulled at his beard angrily. \" You do not talk like a Romany, but Uke a Gorgio of the schools.\" The young man's manner became more confident as he replied. \" Thinking on what was to come to me, I read in the books as the Gorgio reads. I sat in my tent and worked with a pen; I saw in the printed sheets what the world was doing every day. This I did because of what was to come.\" \" And have you read of me in the printed sheets ?

He made as if to go towards her, but something in her look held him back. He realized that Fleda did not wish to speak with him, and that she was even hurrying away from her father, who lumbered through the crowd as though unconscious of them all. Presently Monseigneur Lourde saw Fleda leave the Fete and take the road towards home. There was a sense of excitement in her motions, and he also had seen that tremulous, embarrassed look in her eyes. It puzzled him. He did not connect it wholly with Ingolby as Madame Thibadeau had done. He had lived so long among primi-tive people that he was more accustomed to study faces than find the truth from words, and he had always been oonsaous that this girl, educated and even intellectual, was at heart as primitive as the wildest daughter of the tepees of the North. There was also in her something of that mystery which belongs to the universal itiner-ary—that cosmopoUtan something which is the native human. \" She has far to go,\" the priest said to himself as he turned to greet Ingolby with a smile, bright and shy, but gravely reproachful, too. This happened on the day before the collision between the railway-men and the river-drivers, and the old priest abeady knew what trouble was afoot. There was Uttle Felix Marchand did which was hidden from him. He made his way to Ingolby to warn him. As Ingolby now walked in the woods towards Gabriel Druse's house, he recalled one striking phrase used by the aged priest in reference to the closing of the railway offices \" When you strike your camp, put out the fires.\" was the aphorism. Ingolby stopped humming to himself as the",

She wore a dress of golden brown which matched her hair, and at her throat was a black velvet ribbon with a brooch of antique paste which flashed the light like diamonds, but more softly. Suddenly, as she came on, she stopped and raised her head in a listening attitude, her eyes opening wide as if listening, too— it was as though she heard with them as well; alive to catch sounds which evaded capture. She was like some creature of an ancient wood with its own secret and immemorial history which the world could never faiow. There was that in her face which did not belong to civilization or to that fighting world of which Ingolby was so eager a factor. All the generations of the wood and road, the combe and the river, the quarry and the secluded boscage were in her look. There was that about her which was at once elusive and primevally real. She was not of those who would be lost in the dust of futility. Whatever she was, she was an independent atom in the mass of the world's breeding. Perhaps it was consciousness of the dynamic quality in the girl, her nearness to naked nature, which made Madame Bulteel say that she would \" have a history.\" If she got twisted as she came wayfaring, if her mind became possessed of a false passion or purpose which she thought a true one, then tragedy would await her. Vet in this quiet wood so near to the centuries that were before Adam was, she looked like a spirit of comedy listen-ing till the Spirit of the Wood should break the silence. Ingolby felt his blood beat faster. He had a feeling that he was looking at a wood-nymph who might flash out of his vision as a mere fantasy of the nfind. There shot through him the strangest feeUng that if she were his, he would be linked with something alien to the world of which be",

After all, it was not strange that some one should be singing in that deepest wood beyond. Now Fleda moved forward towards where he stood, quickening her footsteps as though remembering some-thing she must do. He stepped out into the path and came to meet her. She heard his footsteps, saw him, and stood still abruptly. She did not make a sound, but a hand went to her bosom quickly, as though to quiet her heart or to steady herself. He had broken suddenly upon her intent thoughts, he had startled her as she had been seldom startled, for all her childhood training had been towards self possession before surprise and danger. This is not your side of the Sagalac,\" she said with a half -smile, regaining composure. \" That is in dispute,\" he answered gaily. \" I want to belong to both sides of the Sagalac, I want both sides to belong to each other so that either side shall not be my side or your side, or \" \" Or Monsieur Felix Marchand's side,\" she interrupted meaningly. \" Oh, he's on the outside I\" snapped the fighter, with a hardening mouth. She did not reply at once, but put her hat on, and tied the ribbons loosely under her chin, looking thoughtfully into the distance. \" Is that the Western slang for saying he belongs no-where ?\" she asked. \" Nowhere here,\" he answered with a grim twist to the comer of his mouth, his eyes half-closing with sulky meaning. \" Won't you sit down ?\" he added quickly, in a more sprightly tone, for he saw she was about to move on.

A Romany tent or a Romany camp, with its families, was the whole territory of their enterprise, designs and patriotism. They saw the thousand places where cities could be made, and built their fires on the sites of them, and camped a day, and were gone, leaving them waiting and barren as before. They travelled through the new lands in America from the fringe of the Arctic to Patagonia, but they raised no roof-tree; they tilled no acre, opened no market, set up no tabernacle: they had neither home nor country. Fleda was the heir of all this, the product of generations of such vagabondage. Had the last few years given her the civic sense, the home sense ? From the influence of the Englishwoman, who had made her forsake the Romany life, had there come habits of mind in tune with the women of the Sagalac, who were helping to build so much more than their homes ? Since the incident of the Carillon Rapids she had changed, but what the change meant was yet in her imopened Book of Revelations. Yet something stirred in her which she had never felt before. She had come of a race of wayfarers, but the spirit of the builders touched her now. \" What are my plans ?\" Ingolby drew a long breath of satisfa :tion. \" Well, just here where we are will be seen a great thing.

Even as she rejected it, it asserted its power, troubled her, angered her, humiliated her, called to her. She was glad of tlus meeting with Ingolby. It had helped her. She had set out to do a thing she dreaded, and It was easier now than it would have been if they had not met. She had been on her way to the Hut in the Wood, and now the dread of the visit to Jethro Fawe had diminished. The last voice she would hear before she entered Jethro Fawe's prison was that of the man who represented to her, however vaguely, the life which met bt hei future-4he settled Ufe, the life of Society and not of the Saracen. After he had told his boyhood story they sat in sUence for a moment or two, then she rose, and, turning to him was about to speak. At that instant there came distinctly throofih the wood a faint, trilling sound. Her face paled a Itttie. and the words died upon her Ups. Ingolby, having turned his head as though to listen, did not see the change m her face, and she quickly regained her self-control. \" I heard that sound before,\" he said, \" and I thought from your look you heard it, too.

         "v CHAPTER VII IN WHICH THE PRISONER GOES FREE As Fleda wound her way through the deeper wood, remembering the things which had just been said between herself and Ingolby, the colour came and went in her face. To no man had she ever talked so long and intimately, not even in the iar-ofi days when she lived the Romany U(e. Then, as daughter of the head of all the Romanys, she had her place apart ; and the Romany lads had been few who had talked with her even as a child. Her father had jeatottsly guarded her until the time when she fell under the spell and influence of Lady Barrowdale. Here, by the Sagalac, she had moved among this polyglot people with an assurance of her own separateness which was the position of every girl in the West, but developed in her own case to the nth degree. Never before had she come so near — not to a man, but to what concerned a man; and never had a man come so near to her or what concerned her inmost life. It was not a question of opportunity or temptation — these always attend the footsteps of those who would adventure; but for long she had fenced herself round with restrictions of her own making; and the secrecy and strangeness of her father's course had made this not only possible, but in a sense imperative. The end to that had come. Gaiety, daring, passion, elation, depression, were alive in her now, and in a s\u003einse had found an outlet in a handful of days — indeed since the day when Jethro Fawe and Max Ingolby had cone",

Down beneath evorvthing had been the thought that, as he had prevailed with other women, he could prevail with her; that she would come to him in the end. He had felt, but he had declined to see, the significance of her bearing, of her dress, of her speech, of her present mode of life, of its comparative luxury. Its social distinction of a kind which fted her above even the Gorgios by whom she was ; .ounded A fatuous belief in himself and in his personal powers had deluded him. He had told the truth when he said that no woman had ever appealed to him as she did; that she had blotted out all other women from the book of his adventurous and dissolute life; and he had dreamed a dream of conquest of her when Fortune should hand out to him the key of the situation. Did not the beautiful Russian countess on the Volga flee from her liege lord and share his Ian? When he played his fiddle to the Austrian pnncess, did she not give him a key to the garden where she walked of an evening ? And this was a Romany lass, daughter of his Chieftain, as he was son of a great Romany chief; and what marvel could there be that she who had been made his child wife, should be conquered as others had been ! \" MiDuvel, but I see !\" he repeated in a husky fierce- \"*^^-x T u 1™ ^°^ husband, but you would have killed me If I had taken a kiss from your lips, sealed to me by all our tribes and by your father and mine.\" \" My lips are my own, my life is my own, and when 1 marry, I shall marry a man of my own choosing, and he , -J - :",

Are you sure you got it right ?\" Jowett had unusual shrewd:, jss, some vanity and a humorous tongue. He was a favourite in both towns, and had had the better of both in horse-dealing a score of times. That did not make him less popular. However, it was said he Uked low company, and it was true that though he had \" money in the bank,\" and owned a corner lot or so, \"le seemed to care little what his company was. His most constant companion was Fabian Osterhaut, who was the common property of both towns, doing a little of everything for a hving, from bill-posting to the soUcitation of an insurance agent. For any casual work connected with public functions Osterha- i was indispensable, and he would serve as a doctor's assistant and help cut ofE a leg, be the majordomo for a Sunday-school picnic, or arrange a soirie at a meeting-house with equal impartiaUty. He had been known to attend a temperance meeting and a wake in the same evening. Yet no one ever questioned his bona /E\u003ci«s, and if he had attended mass at Manitou in the morning, joined a heathen dance in Tekewani's Reserve in the afternoon, and Ustened to the oleaginous Rev. Reuben Tripple in the evening, it would have been taken as a matter of course. 93 ^ll 'li, ,'l ill m",

         "Jostling THE SULTAN 103 them all, with a jeer and an oblique joke here and there, and crude chaff on each other and everybody, the settler from the United States asserted himself. He invariably obtruded himself, with quizzical inquiry, half contempt and half respect, on the young Englishman, who gazed round with phlegm upon his fellow adventurers, and made up to the sandy-faced Scot or the cheerful Irishman with his hat on the back of his head, who showed in the throng here and there. This was one of the days when the emigrant and settlers' trains arrived both from the East and from \"the States,\" and Front Street in Lebanon had, from early morning, been alive with the children of hope uad adventure. With hands plunged deep in the capacious pockets of his grey jacket, Ingolby walked on, seeing everything; yet with his mind occupied intently, too, on the trouble which must be faced before Lebanon and Manitou would be the reciprocating engines of his policy. Coming to a spot where a great gap of vacant lai.u showed in the street— land which he had bought for the new offices of hii railway combine— he stood and looked at it abstractedly. Beyond it, a few blocks away, was the Sagalac, and beyond the Sagalac was Manitou, and a little way to the right was the bridge which was the symbol of his policy. His eyes gazed almost unconsciously on the people and the horses and wagons coming and going upon the bridge. Then they were lifted to ♦he tall chimneys rising at two or three points on the outskirts of Maniton. \" They don't know a good thing when they get it,\" he said to himself. \" A strike— why, wages are double what they are in Quebec where most of 'em come from !

I'd change some things. I'd gag some people that are doing terrible harm. It's a real bad business.

To my mind, in the present state of things, it's dynamite.\" Ingolby read the column hastily. It was the report of a sermon delivered the evening before by the Rev.

The busy eagerness of a pioneer life was still a quiet orderiy thing, so immense was the theatre for effort and move-ment.

Here was a chance of speaking face to face with the man who was robbing him. What he should do when they met must be according to circumstances. That did not matter. There was the impulse storming in his brain, and It drove him across tha street as the Boss Doctor wa ked away, and Ingolby entered the shop. All Jethro realized was that the man who stood in his way, the bie nch masterful Gorgio was there. He entered the shop after Ingolby, and stood for an mstant unseen. The old negro barber with his curly white head, slave-black face, and large, shrewd, meditative eyes was standing in a comer with a violin under his chin, his cheek lovingly resting against it, as he drew his bow through the last bars of the melody. He had smiled in welcome as Ingolby entered, ii.stantly rising from his stool, but continuing to play. He would not have stopped in the middle of a tune for an emperor, and he put Ingolby higher than an emperor. For one who hadbeen born a slave and had still the scars of the over-seer s whip on his back, he was very independent. He cut everybody's hair as he wanted to cut it, trimmed each beard as he wished to trim it, regardless of its owner's wishes. If there was dissent, then his customer need not come again, that was aU. There were other barbers in the place, but Berry was the master barber. To have your head massaged by him was never to be forgotten, especially If you found your hat too small for your head in the morning. Also he singed the hair with a skill and care which had ailed many a thinly covered scalp with luxuriant growth, and his hair-tonic, known as \" Smilax \" gave a pleasant odour to every meeting-bouse or church or public hall where the people gathered. Berry was an institu-tion even in this new Western town. He kept his place and he forced the white man, whoever he was, to keep his place",

Jethro put the fiddle to his chin, and drew the bow twice or thrice sweepingly across the strings. Such a sound had never come from Berry's violin before. It was the touch of a bom musician, who certainly had skill, but who had infinitely more of musical passion. \" Made by a slave in the cotton-fields I\" Jethro said with a veiled look, and as though he was thinking of something else: \" Dordi, I'd like to meet a slave Uke that !\" At the Romany exclamation Ingolby swept the man wth a searching look. He had heard the Romany wife of Rulifi Zaphe use the word many years ago when he and Charley Long visited the big white house on the hill. Was the man a Romany, and, if so, what was he doing here ? Had it anything to do with Gabriel Druse and his daughter ? But no— what was there strange in the mm bemg a Romany and plajing the fiddle ?

On such occasions he did not lie to protect himself when called to account, but told the truth per-tinaciously. He was obstinate in his vanity, and carried off his mistakes with aplomb. When asked by Ingolby what he called the Governor General when he took His Excellency over the new railway in Ingolby's private car, he said, \"I called him what everybody called him. I called him ' Succelency.\" \" And \" Succelency \" for ever after the Governor General was called in the West.

Hatred was in his soul, and it showed in the sidelong glance as Ingolby turned to place a chair where he could hear and see comfortably ; yet he had the musician's love of the perfect instrument, and the woods and the streams and the sounds of night and the whisperings of trees and the ghosts that walked in lonely places and caUed across the glens-^1 were pouring into his brain memories which made his pulses move far quicker than the hquor he had drunk could do. •' What do you wish ?\" he asked as he tuned the fiddle.

That which had happened by the Starzke Rjver was now of the Sagalac River. The passions and wUd love and irresponsible deeds of the life he had lived m years gone by were here. It was impossible for Ingolby to resist the spell of the music. Such abandonment he had never seen in any musician, such riot of musical meaning he had never heard. He was conscious of the savagery and the bestial soul of vengeance which spoke through the music, and drowned the joy and radiance and almost ghostly and grotesque frivolity of the earlier passages; but it had no personal meaning to him, though at times it seemed when the Romany came near and bent over him with the ecstatic attack of the music, as though there was a look m the black eyes like that of a man who kills. It had, of course, nothing to do with him; it was the abandonment of a highly emotional nature, he thought. It was only after he had been playing, practically without ceasmg, for three-quarters of an hour, that there came to Ingolby the true interpretation of the Romany mutterings through the man's white, wolf-Uke teeth. He did not shrink, however, but kept his head and watched. Once, as the musician flung his body round in a sweep of passion, Ingolby saw the black eyes flash to the weapons on the wall with a malign look which did not belong to the music alone, and he took a swift estimate of the situation. Why the man should have any intentions against him he could not guess, except that he might be one of the mad-men who have a vendetta against the capitalist. Or was he a tool of Felix Marchand ? It did not seem possible, and yet if the man was penniless and an anarchist maybe' there was the possibility. Or— the blood rushed to his face— or it mi^t be that the Gipsy's presence here,",

Tie music swelled to a swirling storm, crashed and flooded the feeUngs with a sense of shipwreck and chaos, through which a voice seemed to cry— the quiver and delicate shrilhiess of one isolated string— and then fell a sudden silence, as though the end of all things had come; and on the silence the trembUng and attenuated note which had quivered on the lonely string, rising, nsmg, piercing the infinite distance uid sinking into silence again. In the pause which foUowed the Romany stood panting, his eyes fixed on Ingolby with an evil exaltation which made him seem taUer and bigger than he was, but gave him, too, a look of debauchery like that on the face of a satyr. Generations of unbridled emotion, of license of the fields and the covert showed in his unguarded features. \" What did the single cry— the motif— express ?\" Ingolby asked coolly. •• I know there was catastrophe, the tumblings of avalanches, but the voice that cried— the soul of a lover, was it ?\" The Romany's lips showed an ugly grimace. \" It was the soul of one that betrayed a lover, going to eternal tortures.\" Ingolby laughed carelessly. \" It was a fine bit of work.

For a Uttle time the room was packed, then some of the more restless spirits, their thirst assuaged, sallied forth to taste the lager and old rye elsewhere, and \" raise Cain \" in the streets. When they went, it became possible to move about more freely m the big bar-room, at the end of which was a bjUiaid-table. It was notable, however, that the more sullen elements stayed.

Some were Men- nonites, Doukhobois and Finlanders, some Swedes, Nor-wegians and Icelanders. Others again were birds of passage who would probably never see Manitou in the future, but they were mostly French, and mostly Catholic, and enemies of the Orange Lodges wherever they were, east or west or north or south. They all had a common ground of unity— half-savage coureurs-de-bots, river- drivers, raUway-men, factory hands, cattlemen, farmers, labourers ; they had a gift for prejudice, and taking sides on something or other was as the breath of the nostrils to them. The greater number of the crowd were, however, excitable, good-natured men, who were by instinct friendly, save when their prejudices were excited; and their oaths and exclamations were marvels of droll ingenuity. Most of them were still too good-humoured with drink to be dangerous, but aU hoped for trouble at the Orange funeral on principle, and the anticipated strike had elements of \"thriU.\" They were of a class, however, who would swing from what was good-humour to deadly anger in a minute, and turn a wind of mere prejudice into a hurricane of hfe and death with the tick of a clock. They would aU probably go to the Orange funeral to-morrow in a savage spirit. Some of them were loud in denunciation of Ingolby and \" the Lebanon gang \" ; they joked coarsely over the dead Orangeman, but their cheerful violence had not yet the appearance of realiiy.

There are hundreds more workmen in both the towns than there were when he came. It was he made others come with much money and build the factories and the mills. Work means money, money means bread, bread means Ufe— so.\" The big river-driver, seeing the effect of the old man's words upon the crowd, turned to them with an angry gesture and a sneer. \" I s'pose Ingolby has paid this old skeesicks for talking this swash.

He's done harm to Manitou— he's against Manitou every time.\" Murmurs of approval ran through the crowd, though some were silent, looking curiously at the forceful and confident old man. Even his bent shoulders seemed to suggest driving power rather than the weight of years. He suddenly stretched out a hand in command as it were. \" Comrades, comrades,\" he said, \"every man makes mistakes. Even if it was a mistake for Ingolby to take away the offices from Manitou, he's done a big thing for both cities by combining the three railways.\" \" Monopoly,\" growled a voice from the crowd. \" Not monopoly,\" the old man repUed with a ring to his voice, which made it younger, fresher. \" Not monopoly, but better management of the railways, with more wages, more money to spend on things to eat and drink and wear, more dollars in the pocket of everybody that works in Manitou and Lebanon. Ingolby works, he doesn't loaf.\" \" Oh, gosh all hell, he's a dynamo,\" shouted a voice from the crowd. \" He's a dynamo running the whole show— eh !\" The old man seemed to grow shorter, but as he thrust his shoulders forward, it was Uke a machine gathering energy and power. \" I'll tell you, friends, what Ingolby is trying to do,\" he said in a low voice vibrating with that force which belongs neither to age nor youth, but is the permanent activity uniting all ages of a man. \" Of course, Ingolby is ambitious and he wants power.

Like hghtning the old man straightened himself, snatched the wig and beard away from his head and face, and with quiet fearlessness said: \" Yes, I am Ingolby.\" For an instant there was absolute silence, in which Ingolby weighed his chances. He was among enemies. He had meant only to move among the crowd to discover their attitude, to find things out for himself. He had succeeded, and his belief that Manitou could be swayed m the nght direction if properly handled, was correct. Beneath the fanaticism and the racial spirit was human nature; and untU Jethro Fawe had appeared, he had hoped to prevent violence and the coUision at to-moiiow's funeral. Now the situation was ail changed. It was hard to tell what sharp turn things might take. He was about to speak, but suddenly from the crowd there was spat out at him the words, \" Spy I Sneak I Spy !\" Instantly the wave of feeling ran against him. He smiled frankly, however, with that droU twist of hU mouth which had won so many, and the raillery of his eyes was more friendly than any appeal. \" Spy, if you like, my friends,\" he said firmly and dwrly. •' Moses sent spies down into the Land of Promise, and they brought back big bunches of grapes.

CHAPTER XI THE SENTENCE OP THE PAniN Fleda waked suddenly, but without motion; just a wide opening of the eyes upon the darkness, and a swift beating of the heart, but not the movement of a muscle. It was as though some inward monitor, some gnome of the hidden life had whispered of danger to her slumbering •pirit. The waking was a complete emergence, a vigilant and searching attention. There was something on her breast weighing it down, yet with a pressure which was not weight alone, and maybe was not weight at all as weight is understood. Instantly there flashed through her mind the primitive belief that a cat will lie upon the breasts of children and suck their breath away. Strange and even absurd as it was, it seemed to her that a cat was pressing and pressing down upon her breast. There could be no mistaking the feline presence. Now with a sudden energy of the body, she threw the Thing from her, and heard it drop, with the softness of feline feet, on the Indian rug upon the floor. Then she sprang out of bed, and, feeling for the matches, lit a candle on the small table beside her bed, and moved it round searching for what she thought to be a cat. It was not to be seen. She looked under the bed; it was not there .-under the washstand, under the chest of drawers, under the improvised dressing-table ; and no cat was to be found. She looked under the chair over which hung her clothes, even behind the dresses and the Indian deer-skin cape hanging on the door. There was no Ufe of any kind save her own in the room,",

Placing the matches beside the candlestick, she blew out the light. Then, half-turning on her side with her face to the wall, she composed herself to sleep. Resolutely putting from her mind any sense of the supernatural, she shut her eyes with confidence of coming sleep. While she was, however, still within the borders of wakefulness, and wholly conscious, she felt the Thing jump from the floor upon her legs, and crouch there with that deadening pressure which was not weight. Now with a start of anger she raised herself, and shot out a determined hand to seize the Thing, whatever it was. Her hand grasped nothing, and again she distinctly heard a soft thud as of something jumping on the floor. Ex-asperated, she drew herself out of bed, lit the candle again, and began another search. Nothing was to be seen; but she had now the curious sense of an uriieen presence. She went to the door, opened it, and looked out into the narrow hall. Nothing was to be seen there. Then she closed the door again, and stood looking at it meditatively for a moment. It had a lock and key; yet it had never been locked in the years they had lived on the Sagalac. She did not know whether the key would turn in the lock. After a moment's hesitation, she shrugged her shoulders and turned the key. It rasped, proved stubborn, but at last came home with a click. Then she turned to the window. It was open about three inches at the bottom. She closed it tight, and fastened it, then stood for a moment in the middle of the room looking at both door and window. She was conscious of a sense of sufiocation. Never in her life had she slept with door or window or tent -flap entirely closed. Never before had she been shut in all night behind closed doors and sealed windows.",

The doors and windows were sealed tight, and there was noth-ing to be seen; yet she was more than ever conscious of a presence grown more manifest. For a moment she stood staring straight before her at the place where it seemed to be. She realized its malice and its hatred, and an intense anger and hatred took possession of her. She had always laughed at such things even when thrilled by wonder and manufactured terrors. But now there was a sense of conflict, of evil, of the indefinable things in which so many believed. Suddenly she remembered an ancient Sage of her tribe, who, proficient in mjrsteries and secret rites gathered from nations as old as Phoenicia and Egypt and as modem as Switzerland, held the Romanys of the world in awe, for his fame had travelled where he could not follow. To Fleda in her earliest days he had been like one inspired, and as she now stood facing the intangible Thing, she recalled an exorcism which the Sage had recited to her, when he had sufficiently startled her senses by tales of the Between World. This exorcism was, as he had told her, more powerful than that which the Christian exorcists used, and the symbol of exorcism was not unlike the sign of the Cross, to which was added genuflection of Assyrian origin. At any other time Fleda would have laughed at the idea of using the exorcism; but all the ancient supersti-tion of the Romany people latent in her now broke forth and held her captive. Standing with candle raised above her head, her eyes piercing the space before her, she recalled every word of the exorcism which had caught the drippings from the fountains of Chaldean, Phoenician, and Egjfptian mystery. Solemnly and slowly the exorcism came from her lips, and at the end her right hand made the cabalistic sign ; then she stood like one transfixed with her arm extended towards the Thing she could not",

         "11 162 THE WORLD FOR SALE Bosnian, Roomelian, and Roumanian bills, green fields by the Danube, with peasant voices drowsing in song before the lights went out; a gallop after dun deer far away up the Caspian mountains, over waste places, carpeted with Sowers after a benevolent rain ; mornings in Egypt, when the camels thudded and slid with melan-choly ease through the sands of the desert, while the Arab drivers called shrilly for Allah to curse or bless; a tei .-r sunset in England seen from the top of a castle when all the western sky was lightly draped with saffron, gold and mauve and delicate green and purple. Now she slept again, with the murmur of the Sagalac in her ears, and there was a smile at her lips. If one could have seen her through the darkness, one would have said that she was like some \\vild creature of a virgin world, whom sleep had captured and tamed; for, behind the refinement which education and the vigilant influence with which Madame Bulteel had surrounded her, there was in her the spirit of primitive things: of the open road and the wilderness, of the undiscipUned and vagrant life, however marked by such luxury as the ruler of all the Romanys could buy and use in pilgrimage. There was that in her which would drag at her footsteps in this new life. For a full hour or more she slept, then there crept through the fantasies of sleep something that did not belong to slee[\u003e— again something from '^he wakeful world, strange, alien, troubhng.

Presently, with a stir of fright and a smothered cry, she waked to a sound which was not of the super-natural or of the mind's illusions, but no less dreadiul to her because of that .

         "passed. THE SENTENCE OF THE PATRIN 163 What she heard in the darkness wiis a voice which sang there by her window-at it or beneath it-the words otl Komany song. It was a song of violence, which she had heard but a short time before in the trees behind her father's house, when a Romany claimed her as his wife: \" J?\"* ^™' ^ *•\"* to n\u003ey true love. Time was she came to mo \" Only one man would sing that song at her window, or anj-where m this Western world. This was no iUusion of her overwrought senses. There, outside her window, was Jethro Fawe. She sat up and Ustened. leaning on one arm, and staring mto the half-darkness beyond the window, the blind of winch she had not drawu down. There was no moon, but the stars were shining brightly, relieving the intensity of the dark. Thiough the whispering of the trees, and hushing the melancholy of a night-bird-s song, came the wild low note of the Romany epic of vengeance. It had a thnU of exultation. Something in the voice, insistent vibrating, personal, made every note a thrust of victory' In spite of her indignation at the insolent serenade, she thrilled; for the strain of the Past was in her, and it had been fighting with her all night, breaking in upon the Present, tugging at the cords of yonth. The man's daring roused her admiration, even as her anger mounted. If her father heard the singing, there could be no doubt that Jethro Fawe's doom would be seal^i. Gabnel Druse would resent this insolence to the daughter of the Ry of Rys. Word would be passed as silently as the electric spark flies, and one day Jethro Fawe would be found dead, with no due to his slayer Md maybe no sign of violence upon him; for while the Komany people had remedies as old as Buddha thev had poisons as old as Sekhet.",
         "i 164 THE WORLD FOR SALE Suddenly the song ceased, and for a moment there was silence save for the whispering trees and the night- bird's song. Fleda rose from her bed, and was about to put on her dressing-gown, when stw was startled by a voice loudly whispering her name at her window, as it seemed. \" Daughter of the Ry of Rys !\" it called. In anger she started forwsucl to the window, then, realizing that she was in her nightgown, caught up her red dressing-gown and put it on. As she did so she understood why the voice had sounded so near. Not thirty feet from her window there was a solitary oak-tree among the pines, in which was a seat among the branches, and, looking out, she could see a figure that blackened the star-lit duskiness. \" Fleda— daughter of the Ry of Rys,\" the voice called again. She gathered her dressing-gown tight about her, and, going to the window, raised it high and leaned out. \" What do you want ?\" she asked sharply. \" Wife of Jethro Fa we, I bring you news,\" the voice said, and she saw a hat waved with mock courtesy. In spite of herself, Fleda feh a shiver of premonition pass through her. The Thing which had threatened her in the night seemed to her now like the soul of this dark spirit in the trees. Resentment seized her. \" I have news for you, Jethro Fawe,\" she replied. \" I set you free, and I gave my word that no harm should come to you, if you went your ways and did not come again. You have come, and I shaL do nothing now to save you from the Ry's anger. Go at once, or I will wake him.\" \" Will a wife betray her husband ?\" he asked in soft derision.

He waited, but she Old not speak. \"The Goigio of Gorgios of the Sagalac has had a faU,\" he said. Her heart beat fast for an instant, and then the pre-sentiment came to her that the man spoke the truth. In ..?Ji^'\"* °* *''\"' accomplished thing, she became calm. ^^ What has happened ?\" she asked quietly. 'He went prowling in Manitou, and in Barbazon's Tavern they struck him down.\" Who struck him down ?\" she asked. It seemed to her that the night-bird sang so loud that she could scarcely hear her own voice. \"A drunken Gorgio,\" he replied. \"The horseshoe is tor luck all the world over, and it brought its luck to Manitou to-night. It struck down a young Master Gorgio who m white beard and long grey hair went spying.\" She knew m her heart that he spoke the truth. \" He is dead ?\" she asked in a voice that had a strance quietness. \" \" Not yet,\" he answered. \" There is time to wish him luck.\" She heard the ribald laugh with a sense of horror and loathing. \" The hand that brought him down may have been the hand of a Gorgio. but behind the hand was Jethro Fawe. she said in a voice grown passionate again. \"Where IS he ?\" she added. \"At his own house.

It flashed into her mind— what would Max Ingolby think of such a thing ? She flushed. The new Gorgio self of her flushed, and yet the old Romany self, the child of race and heredity had taken no exact account of the strangeness of this situation. It had not seemed unnatural. Even if he had been in her room itself, she would have felt no tithe of the shame that she felt now in asking herself what the Master Gorgio would think, if he knew. It was not that she had less modesty, that any stir of sex was in her veins where the Romany chal was con-cerned; but in the life she had once lived less delicate cognizance was taken of such things, and something of it stayed. \" Listen,\" Jethro said with sudden lowering of the voice, and imparting into his tones an emotion which was in part an actor's gift, but also in large degree a passion now eating at his heart, \" you are my wife by all the laws of our people. Nothing can change it. 1 have waited for you, and I will wait, but you shall be mine in the end. You see to-night— Mi Duvel, you see that fate is with me ! The Gorgio has bewitched you.

I will forget everything, and be true to the queen of my soul. Men die, and Gabriel Druse, he will die one day, and when the time comes, then it would be that you and I would beckon, and all the world would come to us.\" He stretched out a hand to her in the half-darkness. \" I send the blood of my heart to you,\" he continued. \" I am a son of kings. Fleda, daujiter of the Ry of Rys, come to me. I have been bad, but I can be good. I have killed, but I will live at peace. I have cursed, but I will speak the word of blessing.

Stretching up his arms, he made soft murmuring of endearment. She had listened, fascinated in spite of herself by the fire and meaning of his words. She felt that in most part it was true, that it was meant ; and, whatever he was, he was yet a man offering his heart and life, offering a love that she despised, and yet which was love and passion of a kind. It was a passion natural to the people from whom she came, and to such as Jethro Fawe it was something more than sensual longing and the aboriginal \u003e■",

She realized it, and was not whoUy revolted by it, even while her mind was fleeing to where the Master Gorgio lay wounded, it might be unto death; even while she knew that this man before her, by some means, had laid Ingolby low. She was all at once a human being torn by contending forces. Jethro's drop to the ground broke the sudden trance into which his words had thrown her. She shook herself as with an effort of control. Then leaning over the window- sui, and looking down at him, now grown so distinct that she cou^d see his features, her eyes having become used to tbe half-light of the approaching dawn, she said with something almost like gentleness: \" Once more I say, you must go and come no more. You are too far ofi from me. You belong to that which W for the Ignorant, or the low, the vicious and the bad. Behind the free life of the Romany is only the thing that the beasts of the field have.

At that moment footsteps stnnded near, and almost instantly there emerged from a pathway which made a ^ort cut to the house, the hgure of old Gabviel Druse.

It was that which made Jethro Fawe shrink and cower for a moment. Fleda raised her hand suddenly in protest to Gabriel Druse. \" No, no, not that,\" Fleda murmured brokenly to her father, with eyes that looked the pain and horror she felt. Though she repudiated the bond by which the barbarian had dared to call her wife, she heard an inner voice that said to her: \" What was done by the Starzke River was the seal of blood and race, and this man must be nearer than the stranger, dearer than the kinsman, forgiven of his crimes Uke a brother, saved from shame, danger or death when she who was sealed to him can save him.\" She shuddered as she heard the inner voice. She felt that this Other Self of her, the inner-seeing soul which had the secret of the far paths, had spoken truly. Even as she begged her father to withdraw the sentence, it flashed into her mind that the grim Thing of the night was the dark spirit of hatred between Jethro Fawe and the Master Gorgio seeking embodiment, as though Jethro's evil soul detached itself from his body to persecute her. At her appeal, Jethro raised his head. His courage came back, the old insolent self-possession took hold of him again. The sentence which the Ry had passed was worse than death (and it meant death, too), for it made him an outcast from his people, and to be outcast was to be thrown into the abyss. It was as though a man without race or country was banished into desolate space. In a vague way he felt its full significance, and the shadow of it fell on him. \" No, no, no,\" Fleda repeated hoarsely, with that new sense of responsibility where Jethro was concerned. Jethro's eyes were turned upon her now. In the",
         "starlit THE SENTENCE OF THE PATRIN 171 night, just yielding to the dawn, she could faintly see his burning look, could feel, as it were, his hands reach out to claim her; and she felt that while he lived she was not wholly free. She realized that the hand of nomad, dis-orderly barbansm was dragging her with a force which was inhuman, or, maybe, superh'^man. Gabriel Druse could know nothing of the elements fighting in his daughter's soul; he only knew that her interest in the Master Gorgio was one he had never seen before, and that she abhorred the Romany who had brought Ingolby low. He had shut his eyes to the man's unruliness and his daughter's intervention to free him; but now he was without pity. He had come from Ingolby's bedside, and had been told a thing which shook his nigged nature to Its centre-a thing sad as death itself, which he must tell his daughter. To Fleda's appeal he turned a stony face. There was none of that rage in his words which had marked the scene when Jethro Fawe first came to claim what he could not have. There was something in him now more deadly and inevitable. It made him like some figure of mythology implacable, fateful. His great height, his bushy beard and stormy forehead, the eyes over which shaggy eye-brows hung Uke the shrubs on a cliff-edge, his face hned and set Uke a thing in bronze— all were signs of a power which, in passion, would be like that of (Edipus: in the moment of justice or doom would, with unbhnking eyes, slay and cast aside as dftris is tossed upon the dust-heap. As he spoke now his voice was toneless. His mind was flint, and his tongue was but the flash of the flint.

The strain of generations, the tradition of the race without a country was stronger than the revolt in his soul. He was young his blood was hot and brawling in his veins, he was ali carnal, with the superior intelligence of the trained animal, but custom was stronger than all. He knew now that whatever he might do, some time, not far, his doom would fall upon him suddenly, as a wind shoots up a ravine from the desert, or a night-bird rises from the dark. He set his feet stubbornly, and raised his sullen face and fanatical eyes.

His face, naturaUy colourless, was almost white, and his eyes were moist. Ho had what the West called nerve. That the cnsis through which he had passed was that of a friend's life did not lessen the poignancy of the experience. He had a smgularly reserved manner and a rare economy of words; also, he had the refinement and distinction of one who had, aforetime, moved on the higher ranges of social ufe. He was always simply and comfortably and in a ^nse fashionably dr.?ssed. yet there was nothing of the dude about him, and hi- black satin tie gave him an air of old-worldishness which 'omehow compelled an extra amount of respect. This, in spite of the fact that he had l\u003eeen known as one who had left the East and come into the wilds because of a woman not his wife. It was not, however, strictly true to say that he had come West because of a woman, for it was on account of three women, who by sudden coincidence or collusion sprang a situation from which the only rehef was flight. In that he took refuge, not because he was a coward, but because it was folly to fight a woman, or three women and because it was the only real solution of an ungovernable situation. At first he had drifted from one town to another, dissolute and reckless, apparently unable to settle down,' or to forget the unwholesome three. But one day there was a terrible railway accident on a construction train, and Lebanon and Manitou made a call upon bis skiU, and",

         "-\"'•!, 176 THE WORLD FOR SALE \" Why don'i you turn on the light ?\" It was thus Rockwell knew that the Master Man, the inend of Lebanon and Manitou, was stone blind. When Ingolby's voice ceased, a horrified silence filled the room for a moment. Even Jim Beadle, his servant standmg at the foot of the bed, clapped a hand to his mouth to stop a cry, and the nurse turned as white as the apron she wore. Dumbfounded as Rockwell was, with instant profes-sional presence of mind he said : \"No, Ingolby, you must be kept in darkness a while yet.\" Then he whipped out a silk handkerchief from his pocket. \"We will have light.\" he continued, \"but we must bandage you first to keep out the glare and prevent pam. The nerves of the eyes have been injured.\" Hastily and tenderly he bound the handkerchief round the sightless eyes. Having done so, he said to the nurse with unintentional quotation from the gospel of St. John, and a sad irony, \" Let there be light.\" It all gave him time to puU himself together and prepare for the moment when he must tell Ingolby the truth. In one sense the sooner it was told the better, lest Ingolby should suddenly discover it for himself. Surprise and shock must be avoided. So now he talked in his low soothing voice, telling Ingolby that the operation had put him out of danger, that the pain now felt came chiefly from the nerves of the eye, and that quiet and darkness were necessary. He insisted on Ingolby keeping silent, and he gave a mild opiate which induced several hours' sleep. During this time Rockwell prepared himself for the ordeal which must be passed as soon as possible; gave all needed directions, and had a conference with the assistant Chief Constable to whom he confided the truth. He suggested plans for preserving order in excited Lebanon, which was determined to revenge itself on Manitou;",

For a long minute Rockwell held the cold hand in the grasp of one who loves and grieves, but even so the physician and surgeon in him were uppermost, as they should be, in the hour when his friend was standing on the brink of despair, maybe of catastrophe irremediable. He did not say a word yet, however. In such moments the vocal are dumb and the blind see. Ingolby heaved himself in the bed and threw up his arms, wresting them from Rockwell's grasp. \" My God— oh, my God— blind !\" he cried in agony.

There was the Boss Doctor: but Rockwell was tied to his own responsibUities, and he could not give up, of course, would not give up his life to the schemes of another. There were a dozen men whom he had helped to forge ahead by his ovm schemes, but their destinies were not linked with his. Only one whose life was linked with his could be trusted to be his eyes, to be the true reporter of all he did, had done, or planned to do. Only one who loved him. But even one who loved him could not carry through his incompleted work against the assaults of his enemies, who were powerful, watchful, astute and merciless; who had a greed which set money higher than aU else in the world They were of the new order of things in the New World. The business of life was to them not a system of barter and exchange, a giving something of value to get something of value, with a margin of profit for each, and a sense of human equity behind; it was a cockpit where one man sought to get what another man had— and eet it almost anyhow. It was the work of the faro-bank man, whose sleight-of- hand deceived the man that carried the gun. All the old humanity and good-feUowship of the trader the man who exchanged, as it was in the olden days of the world and continued in greater or less degree till the '",
         "\\m IM THE WORLD FOR SALE present generation— all that was gone. It was held in contemjjt. It had prevailed when men were open robbers and filibusters and warriors, giving their Uves, if need be to get what they wanted, making force their god. It had triumphed over the violence and robbery of the open road until the dying years of one century and the young years of a new century. Then the day of the trickster came and men laughed at the idea of fair exchange and strove to give an illusive value for a thing of real value— the remorseless sleight-of-hand which the law could not reach. The desire to get profit by honest toiling was dying down to ashes. Against such men had Ingolby worked— the tricksters, the manipulators. At the basis of his schemes was or-ganization and the economy which concentrated and conserved energy begets, together with its profit. He had been the enemy of waste, the apostle of frugality and thrift ; and it was that which had enabled him, in his short career, to win the confidence of the big men behind him in Montreal, to make good every step of the way. He had worked for profit out of legitimate product and in-dustry and enterprise, out of the elimination of waste. It was his theory (and his practice) that no bit of old iron, no bolt or screw, no scrap of paper should be thrown away; that the cinders of the engines could and should be utihMd for that which they would make; and that was why there was a paper-mill and foundry on the Sagalac at Manitou. That was why and how, so far, he had beaten the tricksters. But while his schemes flashed before his mind, as the opiate suspended him in the middle heaven between sleep and waking, the tricksters and manipulators came hurrying after him like mp-?nders that waited for the moment when they could rush the camp in the watches of the night. His disordered imagination saw the ruin and wreck of his work, the seizure of what was his own— the place of control on his railways, the place of the Master Man who cared mfinitely more to see his designs accomplished, than",
         "for \" LET THERE BE LIGHT \" 186 the profit they would bring to himself. Yesterday he had been just at the top of the hill. The key in his fingers was tuniing in the lock which would make safe the securities of his hfe and career, when it snapped, and the world grew dark as the black curtain fell and shut out the lighted room from the wayfarer in the gloom. Then, it was, came the opaque blackness which could be felt, and his voice calling in despair : ' ' Blind 1 I am blind /\" He did not know that he had taken an opiate, that his fnend had mercifuUy atrophied his rebeUious nerves. These visions he was seeing were terribly true, but they somehow gave him no physical torture. It was as though one saw an operation performed upon one's body with the nerves stilled and deadened by ether. Yet he was cruelly conscious of the disaster which had come to him. For a time at least. Then his mind seemed less acute, the visions came, then without seeing them go, they went. And others came in broken patches, shreds, and dreams, phantasmagoria of the brain, and at last all were mingled and confused; but as they passed they seemed to bum his sight. How he longed for a cool bandage over his eyes, for a soft linen which would shut out the cumuli of broken hopes and designs, life's goals obliterated ! He had had enough of the black procession of futile things. His longing was not denied, for even as he roused him-self from the obUvior. v.oming on him, as though by a last effort to remember his dire misfortune, maybe his ever- iastmg tragedy, something soothing and soft Uke linen dipped in dew was laid upon his forehead. A cool, dehcious hand covered his eyes caressingly; a voice from spheres so far away that worlds wire the echoing points of the sound, came whispering to him like a stir of wings in a singing grove. With a last effort to remain in the waking world, he raised his head so very little, but fell gently back again with one sighing word on his lips • \" Fleda !\"",

His great height, vast proportions, and silent ways gave him a place apart, and added to the super-stitious feeling by which he was surrounded. \" How is he ?\" they asked whisperingly, as they crowded round him. \" The danger is over,\" was the slow, heavy reply. \" He will live, but he has bad days to face.\" ' SVhat was the danger ?\" they asked. \" tever— maybe brain-fever,\" he replied. \" We'll see him through,\" someone said. \" Well, he cannot see himself through,\" rejoined the old man solemnly.

There .vas a moment of shock, of hushed surprise, and then a voice burst forth : \" Blind— they've blinded him, boys ! The dagos have killed his sight.

Osterhaut held up the horseshoe which had brought Ingolby down. \" Here it is, the thing that done it. It's tied with a blue ribbon— for luck,\" he added ironically. \"It's got his blood -n it.

At Kyle's question his eyes U^jhted up with a fire that was struck from a flint in other spheres, and he answered: \" It is for the ruler to take Ufe, not the subject.

First among those who crowded round her at Carillon that day were Jowett and Osterhaut, who had tried to warn her. \" You are going to him ?\" she said now with confidence in her eyes, and by the in imacy of the phrase (as though she could speak of Ingolby only as Mm) their own under-standing was complete. \" To see how he is and then to do other things,\" Jowett answered. There was silence for a moment in which they moved slowly forward, and then she said: \" You were at Bar- baxon's last night ?\" \" When that Gipsy son of a dog gave him away !\" he assented. \"I never heard anything Uke the speech Ingolby made.

She was in that fluttering state which follows a girl's discovery that she is a woman, and the feeling dawns that she must complete herself by joining her own life with the life of another. She showed no agitation, but her repression gave an almost statuesque character to her face and figure. The adventurous nature of her early hfe had given her a power to meet shock and danger with coolness, and though the news of Ingolby's tragedy had seemed to freeze the vital forces in her, and all the world became blank for a moment, she had controlled herself and had set forth to go to him,' come what might. As she entered the street where Ingolby hved, she sudd.enly realized the difficulty before her.

         "u;j CHAPTER XIV SUCH THINGS MAY NOT BE A FEW hours .'.-Iter Fleda slowly made her way home-ward through the woods on the Manitou side of the Sagalac. Leaving Ingolby's house, she had seen men from the ranches and farms and mines beyond Lebanon driving or riding into the town, as though to a fair or fete-day. Word of anticipated troubles had sped through the country-side, and the innate curiosity of a race who greatly love a row brought in sensation-lovers. Some were skimming along in one-horse gigs, a small bag of oats dangling beneath Uke the pendulum of a great clock. Others were in double or triple-seated light wagons — \" democrats \" they were called. Women had a bit of colour in their hats or at their throats, and the men had on clean white collars and suits of \" store-clothes \"—a sign of being on pleasure bent. Young men and girls on rough but serviceable mounts cantered past, laughing and joking, and their loud talking grated on the ear of the girl who had seen a Napoleon in the streets of his Moscow. Presently there crossed her path a gruesomely ugly hearse, with glass sides and cheap imitation ostrich plumes drawn by gorged ravens of horses with egregiously long tails, and driven by an undertaker's assistant, who, with a natural gaiety of soul, displayed an idiotic solemnity by dragging down the corners of the mouth. She turned away in loathing. Her mind fled to a scene far away in the land of the Volga when she was a child, where she had seen buried two men, who had fought for their insulted honour till both",
         "198 SUCH THINGS MAY NOT BE 109 had died of their wounds. She remembered the white and red sashes and the gay scarfs worn by the women at the burial, the jackets with great silver buttons worn by the men, and the silver-mounted pistols and bright steel knives in the garish belts. She saw again the bodies of the two gladiators, covered with crimson robes, carried shoulder-high on a soft bed of interlaced branches to the graves beneath the trees. There, covered with flowers and sprigs i. ;d evergreens, ribbons and favours, the kindly earth hid them, cloaked for their long sleep, while women wept, and men praised the dead, and went back to the open road again cheerily, as the dead would hive them do. If he had died— the man she had just left behind in that torpid sleep which opiates bring— his body would have been carried to his last home in just such a hideous equip-age as this hearse. A shiver of revolt went through her frame, and her mind went to him as she had seen him lying between the white sheets of his bed, his hands, as they had lain upon the coverlet, compact of power and grace, knit and muscular and vital -not the hand for a violin but the hand for a sword. As she had laid her hand upon his hot forehead and over his eyes, he had unconsciously spoken her name. That had told her more of what really was between them than she had ever known. In the presence of the catas-trophe that must endanger, if not destroy the work he had done, the career he had made, he thought of her, spoke her name. What could she do to prevent his ruin ? She must do something, else she had no right to think of him. As though her thoughts had summoned him, she came suddenly upon Felix Marchand at a point where her path resolved itself into two, one leading to Manitou, the other to her own home. There was a maUdous glint in the greenish eyes of the ; t '-ll",
         "..'.I, MO THE WORLD FOR SALE dissolute demagogue as he saw her. His hat made a half-circle before it found his head again. \" You pay early visits, mademoiselle,\" he said, his teeth showing rat-like. \" And you late ones ?\" she asked meaningly. \" Not so late that I can't get up early to see what's going on,\" he rejoined in a sour voice. \" Is it that those who beat you have to get up early ?\" she asked ironically. \" No one has got up earlier than me lately,\" he sneered. \" All the days are not begun,\" she remarked calmly. \" You have picked up quite an education since you left the road and the tan.\" he said with the look of one wxio delivers a smashing 1:\u003elow. \" I am not yet educated enough to know how you get other people to commit your crimes for you,\" she retorted. \" Who commits my crimes for me ?\" His voice was sharp and even anxious. \" The man who told you I was once a Gipsy— Jethro Fawe.\" Her instinct had told her this was so. But had Jethro told all ? She thought not. It would need some catas-trophe which threw him off his balance to make him speak to a Gorgio of the inner things of Romany life; and child-marriage was one of them. He scoffed. \" Once a Gipsy always a Gipsy. Race is race, and you can't put it off and on like— your stoc'cing.\" He was going to say chemise, but race was race, and vestiges of native French chivalry stayed the gross simile on the lips of the degenerate. Fleda's eyes, however, took on a dark and brooding look which, more than anything else, showed the Romany in her. With a murky flood of resentment rising in her veins, she strove to fight back the half-savage instincts of a bygone life. She felt as though she could willingly sentence this man to death as her father had done Jethro Fawe",
         "that SUCH THINGS MAY NOT BE 201 very morning. Another thought, however, was working and fighting in her— that Marchand was better as a friend than an enemy; and that while Ingolby's fate was in the balance, while yet the Orange funeral had not taken place and the strikes had not yet come, it might be that he could be won over to Ingolby. Her mind was thus involun-tarily reproducing Ingolby's policy, as he had declared it to Jowett and RockweU. It was to find Felix Marchand's pnce. and to buy off his enmity— not by money, for Marchand did not need that, but by those other coins of value which are individual to each man's desires, passions and needs. \" Once a Frenchman isn't always a Frenchman,\" she replied cooUy, disregarding the coarse insolence of his last utterance. \" You yourself do not now swear faith to the tricolour or the fleur-de-lis.\" He flushed. She had touched a tender nerve. I am a Frenchman always,\" he rejoined angrily. \" I hate the English. I spit on the English flag.\" Yes, I've heard you are an anarchist,\" she rejoined. \" A man with no country and with a flag that belongs to no country— ^«(!//e affaire et quelle ir6lerie !\" She laughed. Taken aback in spite of his anger, he stared at her. How good her French accent was ! If she would only speak altogether in that beloved language, he could smother much malice. She was beautiful and— weU, who could tell ? Ingolby was wounded and blind, maybe for eve.-, and women are always with the top dog— that was his theory. Perhaps her apparent dislike of him was only a mood. Many women that he had conquered had been just like that. They had begun by disUking him— from Lil Samia down— and had ended by being his. This ijrl would never be his in the way that the others had .jen, but— who could tell ?— perhaps he would think enough of her to marry her ? Anyway, it was worth while making such a beauty care for him.",

He had never had one; he was not sure that any girl or woi.ian he had ever known had ever loved him, and he was certain that he had never loved any girl or woman. To be in love would be a new and piquant experience for him. He did not know love, but he knew what passion was. He had ever been the hiinter. This trail might be dangerous, too, but he would take his chances. He had seen her dislike of him whenever they had met in the past, and he had never tried to soften her attitude towards him. He had certainly whistled, but she had not come. Well, he would whistle again — a different tune. \" You speak French much ?\" he asked almost eagerly, the insolence gone from his tone. \" Why didn't I know that ?\" \" I speak FreriCh in Manitou,\" she replied, \" but nearly all the French speak English there, and so I speak more English than French.\" \" Yes, that's it,\" he rejoined almost angrily again. \" The EngUsh will not learn French, will not speak French. They make us learn English, and \" \" If you don't like the flag and the country, why don't you leave it ?\" she interrupted, hardening, though she had meant to try and win him over to Ingolby's side. His eyes blazed. There was son.ething almost real in the man after all. \" The English can kill us, they can grind us to the dust,\" he rejoined in French, \" but we will not leave the land which has always been ours. We settled it; our fathers gave their lives for it in a thousand places. The Indians killed them, the rivers and the storms, the plague and the fire, the sickness and the cold wiped them out. They were burned alive at the stake, they were flayed; their bones were broken to pieces by stones— but",

He did his part last night, and he's still free.\" They had entered the last little stretch of wood in which her home lay, and she slackened her footsteps slightly. She felt that she had been unwise in challenging him ; that she ought to try persistently to win him over. It was repugnant to her, still it must be done even yet. She mastered herself for Ingolby's sake and changed her tactics. \" As you glory in what you have done, you won't mind being responsible for all that's happened,\" she replied in a more friendly tone. She made an impulsive gesture towards him. \" You have shown what power you have — ^isn't that enough ?\" she asked. \" You have made the crowd shout, ' Vive Marchand /' You can make everything as peaceful as it is now upset.

He spread out his hands with the air of a man who had unpacked his soul, but the chief characteristic of his manner was egregious belief in himself. At first, in her desire to find a way to meet the needs of Ingolby, Fleda had listened to him with fortitude and even without revolt. But as he began to speak of women, and to refer to herself with a look of gloating which men of his breed cannot hide, her angry pulses beat hard. She did not quite know where he was leading, but she was sure he meant to say something which would vex her beyond bearing. At one moment she meant to cut short his narrative, but he prevented her, and when at last he ended, she was almost choking with agitation. It had been borne in upon her as his monologue proceeded, that she would rather die than accept anything from this man —anything of any kind. To fight him was the only thing. Nothing else could prevail in the end. His was the service of the unpenitent thief. \" And what is it you want to buy from me ?\" she asked evenly. He did not notice, and he could not realize that ominous thing in her voice and face. \" I want to be friends",

One cannot spend one's time talking and wandering in the woods and teaching and learning. After that, what ?\" \" I have a house in Montreal,\" he said evasively. \" I don't want to live there alone.\" He laughed. \" It's big enough for two, and at the end it might be us two, if \" With sharp anger, yet with coolness and dignity she broke in on his words. \" Might be us two !\" she exclaimed. \" I have never thought of making my home in a sewer.

I know you will try to injure Mr. Ingolby; and 1 know that you will try to injure me; but you will not succeed.\" She turned and moved away from him quickly, taking the path towards her own front door. He called something after her, but she did not or would not heir. As she entered the open space in front of the house, she heard footsteps behind her and turned quickly, not with-out apprehension. A woman came hurrying towards her. She was pale, agitated, haggard with fatigue. \" May I speak with you ?\" she asked in French. \" Surely,\" replied",

She made a motion of her head backwards towards the wood. \" About M'sieu' Marchand.\" Fleda's face hardened; she had had more than enoxigh of \" M'sieu' Marchand.\" She was bitterly ashamed that she had, even for a moment, thought of using diplomacy with him. But this woman's face was so forlorn, apart, and lonely, that the old spirit of the Open Road worked its will. In far-o£E days she had never seen a human being turned away from a Romany tent, or (\"jri'-cn from a Romany camp. She opened the door and stood aside to admit the wayfarer. A few moments later, the woman, tidied and freshened, sat at the ample breakfast which was characteristic of Romany home-life. The woman's plate was bountifully supplied by Fleda, and her cup filled more than once by Madame Bulteel, while ^.d Gabriel Druse bulked friendly over all. His face now showed none of the passion and steriuiess which had been present when he passed the Sentence of the Patrin upon Jethro Fawe; nothing of the gloom filling his eyes as he left Ingolby's house. The gracious, bountiful look of the patriarch, of the head of the clan, was upon him.

Her fingers twined and untwined in her lap with a nervousness shown by neither face nor body. Her face was almost apathetic in its despair, but her body had an upright courage. She sighed heavily and began. \" My name is Arabella Stone. I was married from my home over against Wind River by the Jumping Sandhills. \" My father was a lumberman. He was always captain of the gang in the woods, and captain of the river in the summer. My mother was deaf and dumb. It was very lonely at times when my father was away. I loved a boy— a good boy, and he was killed breaking horses. When I was twenty-one years old my mother died. It was not good for me to be alone, my father said, so he must either give up the woods and the river, or he or I must marry. Well, I saw he would not marry, for my mother's face was one a man could not forget.\" The old man stirred in his seat. \" I have seen such,\" he said in his deep voice. \" So it was I said to myself I would marry,\" she con-tinued, \" though I had loved the Boy that died under the hoofs of the black stallion. There weren't many girls at the Jumping Sandhills, and so there were men, now one, now another, to say things to me which did not touch my heart ; but I did not laugh, because I understood that they were lonely. Yet I liked one of them more than all the others. \" So, for my father's sake, I came nearer to Dennis, and at last it seemed I could bear to look at him any time of the day or night he came to me.

When Dennis went to town again he brought me back a present of a belt with silver clasps; but yet again that night he slept upon the floor alone. So it went on. M.

It was then M'sieu' begun to talk to me; to say things that soothe a woman when she is hurt. I knew now Dennis did not want me as when he first married me. He was that kind of man — quick to care and quicker to forget. He was weak, he could not fasten where he stood. It pleased him to be gay and friendly with me when he was sober, but there was nothing behind it— nothing, nothing at all. At last I began to cry when I thought of it, for it went on and on, and I was too much alone. I looked at myself in the glass, and I saw I was not old or lean. I sang in the trees beside the brook, and my voice was even a little better than in the days when Dennis first came to my father's house. I looked to my cooking, and I knew that it was as good as ever. I thought of ray dothes, and how I did my hair, and asked myself if I was as fresh to see as when Dennis first came to me.

The stricken woman drew herself up and looked Fleda in the eyes. \" I will find the right way, if I can,\" she said with courage. A half-hour later, as the old man sat alone in the room where he had breakfasted, a rifle-shot rang out in the distance. \" The trouble begins,\" he said, as he rose and hastened into the hallv/ay.

The Orange funeral was not to take place until eleven o'clock, and it was only eight o'clock when the Ry left his home. A rifle-shot had, however, been fired across the Sagalac from the Manitou side, and it had been promptly acknowledged from Lebanon. There was a short pause, and then came another from the Lebanon side. It was merely a warning and a challenge. The only man who could have controlled the position was blind and helpless. As Druse walked rapidly towards the bridge, he met Jowett. Jowett was one of the few men in either town for whom the Ry had regard, and the friendliness had had its origin in Jowett's knowledge of horse-flesh. This was a field in which the Ry was himself a master. He had ever ■ been too h' 'h-placed among his own people to trade and barter horses except when, sending a score of Romanys on a hunt for wild ponies on the hills of Eastern Europe, he had afterwards sold the tamed herd to the highest bidders in some Balkan town; but he had an infallible eye for a horse. It was a curious anomaly also that the one man in Lebanon who would not have been expected to love and pursue horse-flesh was the Reverend Reuben Tripple to whom Ingolby had given his congi, but who loved a horse as he loved himself. He was indeed a greater expert in horses than in souls. One of the sights of Lebanon had been the appearance in 819 m .1",
         "jiii 2S0 THE WORLD FOR SALE the field of the \" Reverend Tripple,\" who owned a great, raw-boned bay mare of lank proportions, the winner of a certain great trotting-race which had delighted the mockers. For two years Jowett had eyed Mr. Tripple's rawbone with a piratical eye. Though it had won only a single great race, that, in Jowett's view, was its master's fault. As the Arabs say, hov.ever, Allah is with the patient ; and so it was that on the evening of the day in which Ingolby met disaster, Mr. Tripple informed Jowett that he was willing to sell his rawbone. He was mounted on the gawky roadster when he met Gabriel Druse making for the bridge. Their greeting was as cordial as hasty. Anxious as was the Ry to learn what was going on in the towns, Jowett's mount cau.i,hi his eye. It was but a little time since they had met at Ingolby's house, and they were both full of the grave events afoot, but here was a horse-deal of conse-quence, and the bridle-rein was loose-flung. \" Yes, I got it,\" said Jowett, with a chuckle, interpre-ting the old man's look. \" I got it for good— a wonder from Wonderville. Damned queer-looking critter, but there, I guess we know what I've got. Outside like a crinoline, inside like a pair of ankles of the Lady Jane Plantagenet. Yes, I got it, Mr. Druse, got it dead-on !\" \" How ?\" asked the Ry, feeling the clean fetlocks with affectionate approval. \" He's oft East, so he says,\" was the joyous reply; \"sudden but sure, and I dunno why. Aayvfiy, he's got the door-handle offered, and he's ofi without his camel.\" He stroked the neck of the bay lovingly, \" How much ?\" Jowett held up his fingers. The old man lifted his eyebrows quizzically. \" That— h'm ! Does he preach as well as that ?\" he",
         "asked. THE MAYOR FILLS AN OFFICE 22J Jowett chuckled. \"He knows the home-country better than the New Jerusalem, I guess; and I wasn't oH my feed, nor hadn't lost my head neither. I wanted that dust-hawk, and he knew it; but I got in on him with the harness and the sulky. The bridle he got from a Mexican that come up here a year ago, and went broke and then went dead; and there being no padr$, Tripple did the burying, and he took the bridle as his fee, I s'pose. It had twenty dollars' worth of silver on it— look at these conchs.\" He trifled with the big beautiful buttons on the head-stall. The sulky's as good as new, and so's the harness almost; and there's the nose-bag and the blankets, and a saddle and a monkey-wrench and two bottles of horse- liniment. and odds and ends.

Isn't he good for all day, this one ?\" „ 3* °'^ ™*° nodded, then turned towards the bridge. The gim-shots— what ?\" he asked, setting forward at a walk which taxed the rawbone's stride. \" An invite— come to the wedding; that's all. Only it's a funeral this time, and, if something good doesn't happen, there'll be more than one funeral on the Sagalac to-morrow. I've had my try, but I dunno how it'U come out. He's not a man of much dictionary is the Monseenoor.\" \" The Monseigneur Lourde ? What does he say ?\" \" He says what we all say, that he is sorry.

So It s up to We, Us \u0026 Co. to see the thing through, or go Dust. It don't suit me. It wouldn't have been like this, iMt hadn t been for what happened to the Chief last night. There s no holding the boys in. One thing's sure, the l^ipsy that give Ingolby away has got to lie low if he hasn t got away, or there'll be one less of his tribe to eat the juicy hedgehog. Yes, sir-ee !\" To the last words of Jowett the Ry seemed to pay no attention, though his lips shut tight and a menacing look came into his eyes. They were now upon the bridge, and could see what was forward on both sides of the Sagalac. There was unusual bustle and activity in the streets and on the nver-bank of both towns. It was noticeable also that though the mills were running in Manitou, there were fewer chimneys smoking, and far more men in the streets than usual. Tied up to the Manitou shore were a half-dozen cnbs or rafts of timber which should be floatine •astward down the Sagalac. \" If the Monseenoor can't, or don't, step in, we're bound for a shindy over a corpse,\" continued Jowett after a moment. \" Can the Monseigneur cast a spell over them all ?\" remarked the Ry ironically, for he had little faith in priests, though he had for this particular one great respect.

They could spring and strike an opponent with one foot in the chest or in the face, and spoil the face for many a day, or for ev;r. It was a gift of the backwoods and the lumber-camps, practised in hours of stark monotony when the devils which haunt places of isolation devoid of family life, where men herd together like dogs in a kennel, break loose. There the man that dips his fingers \" friendly-like \" in the dish of his neighbour one minute wants the eye of that neighbour the next : not so much in innate or momentary hatred, as in innate savagery and the primeval sense of combat, the war which was in the blood of the first man. The unarmed appearance of these men did not deceive the pioneer folk of Lebanon. To them the time had come when the reactionary forces of Manitou must receive a check. Even those who thought the funeral fanatical and provocative were ready to defend it. The person who liked the whole business least was Rockwell. He was subject to the same weariness of the flesh and fatigue of the spirit as all men ; yet it was expected of him that at any hour he should be at the disposal of suffering humanity — of criminal or idiotic humanity — patient, devoted, calm, nerve-strung, complete. He was the one person in the community who was the universal necessity, and yet for whom the community had no mercy in its troubles or out of them. There were three doctors in Lebanon, but none was an institution, none had prestige save Rockwell, and he often wished that he had less prestige, since he cared nothing for popularity. He had made his preparations for possible \" accidents \" in no happy mood. Fresh from the bedside of Ingolby, having had no sleep, and with many sick people on his list, he inwardly damned the foolishness of both towns. He even sharply rebuked the Mayor, who urged",

There was a sudden silence. The proposal had come so quietly, and it was so startling, that even the calm Rockwell was taken aback. But his eye and the eye of the Mayor met, and the look in both their faces was the same. \" That's bold play,\" the Mayor said, \" but I guess it goes. Yesterday it couldn't be done. To-day it can.

To call attention to an exag-gerated bunion when the odorous towel lay upon the hidden features of what once was a \" human,\" was the last act in the drama of the Unmaking of Man. Only when the client had felt in his pocket for the price of the flaying, and laid it, with a ten-cent fee, on the ledge beneath the mirror, where all the implements of the inquisition and the restoration were assembled, did he feel manhood restored. If, however, he tried to keep a vow of silence in the chair of execution, he paid a heavy price; for Berry had his own methods of punishment. A little tighter grasp of the nose; a little rougher scrape of the razor, and some sharp, stinging liquid suddenly slapped with a cold palm on the excoriated spot, with the devilish hs^pocrisy of healing it ; a longer smothering-period under the towel, when the comers of it were tucked behind the ears and a crease of it in the mouth — all these soon induced vocal expression again, and Berry started on his inquisi-tion with gentle certainty. When at last he dusted the face with a little fine flour of oatmeal, \" to heal the cuticle and ' manoor ' the roots,\" and smelled with content the hands which had embalmed the hair in verbena-scented oil, a man left his presence feeling that he was ready for the wrath to come. Such was Berry when he had under his razor one of Ingolby's business foes of Manitou, who had of late been in touch with Felix Marchand. Both were working for the same end, but with difierent intentions. Marchand worked with that inherent devilishness which sometimes takes possession of low minds; but the other worked as he would have done against his own brother, for his own business success ; and it was his view that one man could only succeed by taking the place of another, as though the Age of Expansion had ceased and the Age of Smother had",

THE MONSEIGNEUR AND THE NOMAD 231 From this client while in a state of abject subjection, Beny, whose heart was hard that day, but whose diplo-macy was impeccable, discovered a thing of moment. There was to be a procession of strikers from two factories in Manitou, who would throw down their tools or leave their machines at a certain moment. Falling into line these stnkere would march across the bridge between the towns at such time as would bring them into touch with the hne of the Orange funeral— two processions meeting at right angles. If neither procession gave way, the Orange funeral could be broken up, ostensibly not from religious fanaticism, but from the \" unhappy accident \" of two straight lines colliding. It was a juicy plot ; and in a few minutes the Mayor and Gabriel Druse knew of it from the faithful Beiry. The bell of the meeting-house began to toll as the Orange-man whose death had caused such commotion was carried to the waiting carriage where he would ride alone. Almost ^ultaneously with the starting of the gaudy yet sombre Orange cortege, with its yeUow scarfs, glaring banners, charcoal plumes and black clothes, the labour procession approached the Manitou end of the Sagalac bridge. The strikers carried only three or four banners, but they had a band of seven pieces, with a drum and a pair of cymbals. With frequent discord, but with much spirit, the Bleaters as these musicians were caUed in Lebanon, inspired the steps of the Mamtou fanatics and toughs. As they came upon the bridge they were playing a gross paraphrase of The Marseillaise. At the head of the Orange procession was a silver-comet band which the enterprise of Lebanon had made possible. Its leader was a ne'er-do-well young Welshman, who had been dismissed from leader-ship after leadership of bands in the East till at last he had dnfted into Lebanon. Here, strange to say, he had never been drunk but once; and that was the night",

         "'I 234 THE WORLD FOR SALE procession made a rush forward. The apparent leader of the Manitou roughs was a Wack-bearded man of middle height, who spoke raucously to the crowd behind him. Suddenly a powerful voice rang out. \" Halt, in the namt of th* Queen /\" it called. Surprise is the very essence of successful war. The roughs of Manitou had not looked for this. They had foreseen the appearance of the official Chief Constable of Lebanon; they had expected his challenge and warning in the vernacular; but here was something which struck them with consternation— first, the giant of Manitou m the post of command, looking like some berserker; and then the formal reading of that stately document in the name of the Queen. Far back in the minds of every French habitant present was the old monarchical sense. He makes, at worst, a poor anarchist, though he is a good revolutionist; and the French colonials had never been divorced from monarchical France. In the eyes of the most forward of those on the Sagalac bridge, there was a sudden wonderment and confusion. To the dramatic French mind, ceremonial is ever welcome; and for a moment it had them in its grip, as old Gabriel Druse read out in his ringing voice, the trenchant royal summons. It was a strange and dramatic scene— the Orange funeral standing stiD, garish yet solemn, with hundreds of men, rough and coarse, quiet and refined, dissolute and careless, sober and puritanic, broad and tolerant, sharp and fanatical ; the ibour procession, polyglot in appearance, but with Gallic features and looseness of dress predominating; excitable, brutish, generous, cruel; without intellect, but with an intelligence which in the lowest was acute, and with temperaments responsive to drama. As Druse read, his eyes now and then flashed, at first he knew not why, to the slim, bearded figure of the",
         "ap- THE MONSEIGNEUR AND THE NOMAD S8S parent leader. At length he caught the feverish eye of the man, and held it for a moment. It was familiar, but it eluded him; he could not place it. He heard, however, Jowett's voice say to him, scarce above a whisper: \" It's Felix Marchand, boss I\" Jowett also had been puzzled at first by the bearded figure, but it suddenly flashed upon him that the beard and wig were a disguise, that Marchand had resorted to Ingolby's device. It might prove as dangerous a stratagem with him as it had to Ingolby. There was a moment's hesitation after Druse had finished reading— as though the men of Manitou had not quite recovered from their surprise— then the man with the black beard said something to those nearest him. There was a start forward, and someone cried, \" Down with the Orangemen— d bas I'Orangi I\" Like a well-disciplined battalion the Orangemen rolled up quickly into a compact mass, showing that they had planned their defence well, and the moment was black with danger, when, suddenly. Druse strode forward. Flinging right and left two or three river-drivers, he caught the man with the black beard, snatched him out from among the oncoming crowd, and tore ofi the black beard and wig. Felix Marchand stood exposed. A cry of fury rang out from the Orangemen behind, and a dozen men rushed forward, but Gabriel Druse acted with the instant decision of a real commander. Seeing that it would be a mistake to arrest Marchand at that moment, he raised the struggling figure of the wrecker above his head and, with Herculean effort, threw him up over the heads of the Frenchmen in front of him. So extraordinary was the sight thct, as if fascinated, the crowd before and behind followed the action with staring eyes and tense bodies. The faces of all the contending forces were as concentrated for the instant, as though the sun were falling out of the sky. It was",

Even the Orangemen bared their heads in the presence of that Popery which was anathema to them, which they existed to combat, and had been taught to hate. Some, no doubt, would rather have fought than have had peace at the price; but they could not free their minds from the sacred force which had brought most of the crowd of faction-fighters to their knees. With a wave of the hand, Gabriel Druse ordered the cortige forward, and silently the procession with its yellow banners and its sable, drooping plumes moved on. Once on its way again, Willy Welsh and his silver-comet band struck up the hymn, \" Lead Kindly Light.\" It was the one real coincidence of the day that this moving hymn was written by a cardinal of the Catholic Church. It was also an irony that, as the crowd of sullen Frenchmen turned back to Manitou, the train beanng the Mounted PoUce, for whom the Mayor had sent to the capital, steamed noisily in, and redcoats showed at its windows and on the stej-s of the cars.

He was in the throes of that intense visnaliiation which comes with insomnia, when one is awake yet apart from the waking world, where nothing is reaUy real and nothing normal. He had a call to go hence, and be must go. Minute after minute passed, hours passed, and the fight of the soul to maintain itself against the disordered mind went on. All his past seemed but part of a desert, lonely and barren and strange. In the previous year he had made a journey to Arizona with Jowett, to see some raUway construction there, and at a ranch he had visited he came upon some verses which had haunted his mind ever since. They fastened upon his senses now. They were like a lonesome monotone which at length gave calm to his torturing reflections.

And Jim the faithftil one, a* though under a narcotic of fate, was snoring softly beside the vacant room. The streets were still. No lights burned anywhere so far as eye could see. But now and then, in the stillness through which the river flowed on, murmuring and rhythmic, there rose the distant sounds of disorderly voices. Ingolby was in a state which was neither sleep nor waking, which was in part delirium, in part oblivion to all things in the worid save one— an obsession so complete, that he moved automatically through the street in which he lived towards that which led to the bridge. His terrier, as though realizing exactly what he wished, seemed to guide him by rubbing against his legs, and even pressing hard against them when he was in any danger of losing the middle of the road, or swerving towards a ditch or some obstruction. Only once did they pass any human being, and that was when they came upon a camp of road-buUders, where a red light burned, and two men slept in the open by a dying fire. One of them raised his head when Ingolby passed, but being more than half -asleep, and seeing only a man and a dog, thought nothing of it, and dropped back again upon his rough pillow. He was a stranger to Lebanon, and there was little chance of his recognizing Ingolby in the semi-darkness. As they neared the river, Ingolby became deeply agitated . He moved with his hands outstretched. Had it not been for his dog he would probably have walked into the Sagalac; for though he seemed to have an instinct that was extra-natural, he swayed and staggered in the delirium driving him on. There was one dreadful moment when, having swerved from the road leading on to the bridge, he was within a foot of the river-bank. One step farther, and he would have plunged down thirty feet into the stream, to be swept to the Rapids",

He give a whining bark almost human in its meaning, and threw himself at the legs of his master, pushing him back-wards and over towards the road leading upon the bridge, as a collie guides sheep. Presently Ingolby felt the floor of the bridge under his feet ; and now he hastened on, with outstretched arms and her 1 bent forward, listening in-tently, the dog trottini; \u003e ^ij,,-, with what knowledge working in him Heaven lor.

As though in very truth he saw with his eyes, he stopped short not far from the point where the bridge joined the land, and stood still, listening. For several minutes he was motionless, intent as an animal waiting for its foe. At last his newly-sensitive ears heard footsteps approaching and low voices. The foot-steps came nearer, the voices, though so low, became more distinct. They were now not fifty feet away, but to the delirious Ingolby they were as near as death had been when his fingers closed on the pistol in his room. He took a step forward, and with passionate voice and arms outstretched, he cried : \"You shall not do it— by God, you shall not touch my bridge I I built it. You shall not touch it. Back you devils— back !\" The terrier barked loudly. The two men in the semi-darkness in front of him cowered at the sight of this weird figure holding the bridge they had come to destroy.

He had heard Ingolby's wild words, and he reahzed the situation. \" Ingolby-«teady there, Ingolby !\" hecalled. \" Steady I Steady! Gabriel Druse is here.

It was the uncontroUable woman in her, the mother-thing, belonging to the first woman that ever was— protection of the weak, hovering love for the suffering, the ministering spirit. Since Ingolby had been brought to the house in the pmes, Madame Bulteel and herself, with Jim, had nursed him through the Valley of the Shadow. They had nursed him through brain-fever, through agonies which could not have been borne with consciousness. The tempest of the mind and the pains of misfortune went on from hour to hour, from day to day, almost without ceasing, until at last, a shadow of his former self, but with a wonderful hght on his face which came from something within, he waited patiently for returning strength, propped up with pillows in the bed which had been Fleda's own, in the room outside which Jethro Fawe had sung his heathen serenade. It was the room of the house which, catching the morning sun, was best suited for an invahd. So she had given it to him with an eagerness behind which was the feeling that somehow it made him more of the inner circle of her own life; for apart from every other feeling she had, there was m her a deep spirit of comradeship belonging to far-off times when her life was that of the open road, the hiUside and the vale. In those days no man was a stranger- all belonged. ' To lueet, and greet, and pass was the hourly event, but the meeting and the greeting had in it the familiarity of a common wandering, the sympathy of the homeless. Had Ingolby been less to her than he was, there would still have been the comradeship which made her the great creature she was fast becoming.

It was the tragedy of the man stopped in his com^o because of one mistake, though he had done ten thousand wise things. The power taken from his hands, the interrupted life, the dark future, the beginning again, if ever his sight came back: it was sickening, heartbreaking. She saw it all in his face, b ■\u002b as if some inward voice had spoken to him, his face cleared, the swift-moving hands clasped in front of him, and he said quietly: \" But because it's life, there it is.

He asked her a series of questions which she tried to answer frankly, and he came to know that the trouble between the two towns, which, after the Orange funeral and his own disaster had subsided, was up again; that the rail-ways were in difficulties ; that there had been several failures in the town; that one of the banks— the Regent— had closed its doors; that FeUx Marchand, having recovered from the injury he had received from Gabriel Druse on the day of the Orange funeral, had gone East for a month and had returned; that the old trouble was reviving in ■L'iXB mills, and that Marchand had linked himself with the enemies of the group controUing the railways hitherto directed by himself. For a moment after she had answered his questions, there was strong emotion in his face, and then it cleared. He reached out a hand towards her. How eagerly she clasped it ! It was cold, and hers was so warm and firm and kind. \" True friend o' mine I\" he said with feeling. \" How wonderful it is that somehow it all doesn't seem to matter so much. I wonder why? I wonder— Tell me about yourself, about your Ufe,\" he added abruptly, as though it had been a question he had long wished to ask. In the tone was a quiet certainty suggesting that she would not hesitate to answer. ^^ \"We have both had big breaks in our lives,\" he went on. \" I know that. I've lost everything, in a way, by the break in my life, and I've an idea that you gained every-thing when the break in yours came. I didn't believe the story Jethro Fawe told me, but still I knew there was some truth in it ; something that he twisted to suit himself.

It was wanting to worlt a human brain to Its last volt of capacity, and to see what it could do. I s^ppose I became selfish as I foiled on. I didn't mean to be. but concentration upon the things I had to do pre-vented me from being the thing I ought to be. I wanted, as they say, to get there. I had a lot of irons in the fire- too many-but they weren't put there deliberately. One thmg led to another, and one thing, as it were, hung upon another, until they all got to be part of the scheme. Chice tuey got there, I had to carry them all on, I couldn't drop any of them ; they got to be my life. It didn't matter that It aU grew bigger and bigger, and the risks got greater and greater. I thought I could weather it through, and so I could have done, if it hadn't been for a mistake and an accident; but the mistake was mine. That's where the thmg nips— the mistake was mine. I took too big a risk. You see. I'd got so used to being lucky, it seemed as II I couldn t go wrong. Everything had come my way. Ever since I began in that Montreal railway office, after leaving college. I hadn't a single setback. I pulled things off. I made money, and I plumped it all into my raUways and the Regent Bank; and as you said a minute ago. the Regent Bank has closed down. That cuts me clean out of the game. What was the matter with the bank ? The manager ?\" His voice was almost monotonous in its quietness It was as though he told the story of something which had pasoeu leyond chance or change. As it unfolded to her underc:anding, she had seated herself near to his bed. The door of the room was open, and in view outside on the landing sat Madame Bulteel reading. She was not, how-ever, near enough to hear the conversation. Ingolby's voice was low, but it sounded as loud as a waterfall m the ears of the girl. who. in a few weeks,",

' Curious— I dreamed that,\" Ingolby remarked quietly, and leaned down and stroked the dog lying at his feet. It had been with him through all his sickness. -It must have been part of my delirium, because, now that I ve got my senses back, it's as though someone had told me about it. Speculated in my railways, eh ? Chickens come home to roost, don't they ? I suppose I ought to be excited over it aU,\" he continued. \" I suppose I ought. But the fact is, you only have just the one long, big moment of excitement when great trouble and tragedy come, or else it's aU excitement, aU the time, and then you go mad. That's the test, I think. When you're struck by Fate, as a hideous war-machine might strike you, and the whole terror of loss and ruin bears down on you, you're either swept away in an excitement that hasn't any end, or you brace yourself, and become master of the shatterine thing.\" \" \" You are a master,\" she interposed. \" You are the Master Man,\" she repeated admiringly. He waved a hand deprecatingly. \"Do you know when we talk-sd together in the woods soon after you ran the rapids— you remember the day— if you had said that to me then, I'd have cocked my head and thought I was a jim-dandy, as they say.

They may leave you in the bright days, not in the dark days. On the majority of them you couldn't rely in prosperity, but in misfortune you couldn't do anything else. They are there with you. They're made that way. The best life can give you in misfortune IS a woman. It's the great beginning-of-the-world thing in them. Men can't stand prosperity, but women can stand misfortune.

Unless the Gipsies kept their laws sacred they couldn't hold together at all. They're iron and steel, the Gipsy laws. They can't be stretched, and they can't be twisted. They can only be broken, and then there's no argument about it. When they are broken, there's the penalty, and it has to be met.\" Ingolby stopped knitting for a moment. \" You don't mean that a penalty could touch you ?\" he asked in-credulously. \" Not for breaking a law,\" she answered. \" I'm not a Gipsy any more.

         "life TWO LIFE PIECES 271 revealed as great a poetic as dramatic instinct. As she taiked, Ingolby in his imagination pictured her as a girl of ten or twelve, in a dark-red dress, brown curls falling in profusion on her shoulders, with a clear, honest, beau- tiful eye, and a face that only spoke of a joy of living, in which the small things were the small things and the great things were the great: the perfect proportion of sane life in a sane world. Now and again, carried away by the history of things remembered, she visualized scenes for him with the ardour of an artist and a lover of created things. He realized how powerful a hold the old life still had upon her She understood it, too, for when at last she told of the great event in England which changed her life, and made her a deserter from Gipsy life; when she came to the giving of the pledge to a dying woman, and how she had kept that pledge, and how her father had kept It, sternly, faithfully, in spite of all it involved, she said to him : \"It may seem strange to you, living as I live now in one spot, with everything to make life easy, that I should lone sometimes for that old life. I hate it in my heart of hearts, yet there's something about ii that belongs to me, that s behind me, if that tells you anything. Ifs as though there was some other self in me which reached far far back into centuries, that wills me to do this and wills me to do that. It sounds mad to you of course, but there have been times when I have had a wild longing to go back to It all, to what some Gorgio writers call the pariah world— the Ishmaelites.\" More than once Ingolby's heart throbbed heavily against his breast as he felt the passion of her nature, its extra-ordinary truthfuhiess, making it clear to him by indirect phrases that even Jethro Fawe, whom she despised, still had a hateful fascination for her. It was all at variance to her present self, but it summoned her through the",
         "long 272 THE WORLD FOR SALE avenues of ancestry, predisposition; through the secret communion of those who, being dead, yet speak. \" It's a great story told in a great way,\" he said, when she had finished. \" It's the most honest thing I ever heard, but it's not the most truthful thing I ever heard. I don't think we can tell the exact truth about ourselves. We try to be honest ; we are savagely in earnest about it, and so we exaggerate the bad things we do, and we often show distrust of the good things we do. That 's not a fair picture. I believe you've told me the truth as you see it and feel it, but I don't think it's the real truth. In my mind I sometimes see an oriel window in the college where I spent three years. I used to work and think for hours m that oriel window, and in the fights I've been having lately I've looked back and thought I wanted it again; wanted to be there in the peace of it all, with the books, and the lectures, and the drone of history, and the drudgery of examinations; but if I did go back to it, three days'd sicken me, and if you went back to the Gipsy life three days'd sicken you.\" \" Yes, I know. Three hours would sicken me. But what might not happen in those three hours !

She was suddenly angry with herself, angry with him, the poor blind man, back from the Valley of the Shadow. She had not reached the door, however, when Madame Bulteel entered the room. \" The doctor from New York has come,\" she said, holding out a note from Dr. Rockwell. \" He will be here in a couple of hours.\" Fleda turned hack towards the bed. \"Good luckl\" she said. \"You'll see, it will be all right.\" \"Certainly I'll s\u003cre if it's all right,\" he said cheerfully. \"Am I tidy?

From a lonely spot by the river, Fleda watched the westenng gleam until it vanished, her soul alive to the melancholy beauty of it all. Not a human being seemed to be withm the restricted circle of her vision. There were only to be seen the deep woods, in myriad tints of bronze and red and saffron, and the swift -flowing river Overhead was the Northern sky, so clear, so tiirilling, and the stars were beginning to sparkle in the iacredibly swift , twilight which links daytime and nighttime in that Upper Land. Lonely and delicately sad it all looked, but there was no feeling of loneliness among those who lived the hfe of the Sagalac. Many a man has stood on a wide plain of snow, white to the uttermost horizon, or in the yeUow- brown grass of the Summer prairie, empty of all human life so far as eye could see, and yet has felt no solitude. It IS as though the air itself is inhabited by a throng of happy comrades whispering in the communion of the invisible world. As a child Fleda had often gazed upon just such scenes, lonely and luminous, but she was only conscious then of a vague and pleasant awe, a kindly confusion, which, Uke the din of innumerable bees, lulled wonder to sleep. Even as a child, however, something of what it meant had pierced her awe and wonder. Once as she crossed a broken, bare mountain of Roumania she had seen a wild",

It meant so much if they did belong, and she loved to think they did. Many a time she kissed the smooth bole of a maple or whispered to it ; or laid her cheek against a mossy rock and murmured a greeting in the spirit of a companionship as old as the making of the world. On the evening of this day of her destiny— carrying the story of her own fate within its twenty-four hours— she was in a mood of detachment from life's routine. As at a great opera, a sensitive spirit loses itself in visions alien to the music and yet born of it, so she, lost in this primeval scene before her, saw visions of things to be. If Ingolby's sight came back ! In her abstraction she saw him with sight restored and by her side, and even in that joy her mind felt a hovering sense of invasion, no definite, visible thing, but a presence which made shadow. Suddenly oppressed by it, she turned back into the woods from the river-bank to make for home. She had explored nearly every portion of this river-country for miles up and down, but on this evening, lost in her dreams, she had wandered into less familiar regions. There was no chance of her being lost, so long as she kept near to the river, and indeed by instinct and not by thought or cal-culation she made her way about at all times. Turned homeward, she walked for about a quarter of a mile, retreading the path by which she had come. It was growing darker, and, being in unfamiliar surroundings, she hurried on, though she knew well what course to take. Following the bank of the river she would have increased her walk greatly, as the stream made a curve at a point above Manitou, and then came back again to its original course; so rfo: cut across the promontory, taking the most direct line homeward. Presently, however, she became conscious of other people in the wood besides herself. She saw no one,",
         "but THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER 279 she heard breaking twigs, the stir of leaves, the flutter of a partridge which told of human presence. The underbrush was considerable, darkness was coming on, and she had a sense of being surrounded. It agitated her, but she pulled herself together, stood still and admonished herself. She called herself a fool ; she asked herself if she was going to be a coward . She laughed out loud at her own apprehension ; but a chill stole into her blood when she heard near by —there was no doubt about it now— mockery of her own laughter. Then suddenly, before she could organize her senses, a score of men seemed to rise up from the ground around her, to burst out from the bushes, to drop from the trees, and to storm upon her. She had only time to realize that they were Romanys, before scarves were thrown around her head, bound around her body, and, unconscious, she was carried away into the deep woods. When she regained consciousness Fleda found herself in a tent, set in a kind of prairie amphitheatre valanced by shrubs and trees. Bright fires burned here and there, and dark-featured men squatted upon the ground, cared for their horses, or busied themselves near two large caravans, at the doors or on the steps of which now and again appeared a woman. She had waked without moving, had observed the scene without drawing the attention of a man— a sentry— who sat beside the tent -door. The tent was empty save for herself. There v. as little in it besides the camp-bed against the tent wall, upon which she lay, and the cushions supporting her head . She had waked carefully, as it were : as though some inward monitor had warned her of impend-ing danger. She realized that she had been kidnapped by Romanys, and that the hand behind the business was that of Jethro Fawe.

         "form. 282 THE WORLD FOR SALE of a worldly education, of a convention which lifted her away from the tan and the caravan, from the everlasting itmerary. They had not had Jethro's experiences in lashionable hotels of Europe, at midnight parties, at gay suppers, at garish dances, where Gorgio ladies answered the amorous looks of the ambitious Romany with the hddle at his chin. Because these young Romanys knew they dare not aspire, they were resentful; but Jethro, the head of the rival family and the son of the dead claimant to the headship, had not such compulsory modesty. He had ranged far and wide, and his expectations were extensive. He was nowhere to be seen in the groups which sang and gestured in the light of the many coloured fires, though once or twice Fleda's quickened ear detected his voice, exulting, in the chorus of song. Presently, as she stood watching, listening, and strangely moved in spite of herself by the sudden dramatic turn which things had taken, a seat was brought to her. It was a handsome stool, looted perhaps from some chiteau \"1 the Old World, and over it was thrown a dark-red cloth which gave a semblance of dignity to the seat of authority, which it was meant to be. Fleda did not refuse the honour. She had choked back the indignant words which had rushed to her lips as she left the tent where she had been lying. Prudence had bade her await developments. She could not yet make up her mind what to do. It was clear that a bold and deep purpose lay behind it all, and she could not tell how far- r aching it was, nor what it represented of rebellion against her lather's authority. That it did represent rebellion she had no doubt. She was well enough aware of the claims of Jethro 's dead father to the leadership, abandoned for three thousand pounds and marriage with herself; and she was also aware that while her father's mysterious isolation might possibly have developed a reverence for him, yet active pressure and calumny might well",
         "have THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER 283 done its work. Also, if the marriage was repudiated, Jethro would be justified in resuming the family claim to the leadership. She seated herself upon the scarlet seat with a gesture of thanks, while the salutations and greetings increased ; then she awaited events, thrilled by the weird and pleasant music, with its touches of Eastern fantasy. In spite of herself she was moved, as Romanys, men and women, ran forward in excitement with arms raised towards her as though they meant to strike her, then suddenly stopped short, made obeisance, called a greeting, and ran backwards to their places. Presently a group of men began a ceremony or ritual, before which the spectators now and again covered their eyes, or bent their heads low, or turned their backs, and raised their hands in a sort of ascription . As the ceremony neared its end, with its strange genuflections, a woman dressed in white was brought forward, her hands bound behind her, her hair falling over her shoulders, and after a moment of apparent denunciation on the part of the head of the ceremony, she was suddenly thrown to the ground, and the pretence of drawing a knife across her throat was made. As Fleda watched it she shuddered, but presently braced herself, because she knew that this ritual was meant to show what the end must be of those who, like herself, proved traitor to the traditions of race. It was at this point, when fifty knives flashed in the air, with vengeful exclamations, that Jethro Fawe appeared in the midst of the crowd. He was dressed in the well- known clothes which he had worn since the day he first declared himself at Gabriel Druse's home, and, compared with his friends around him, he showed to advantage. There was command in his bearing, and experience of life had given him primitive distinction. For a moment he stood looking at Fleda in undisguised admiration, for she made a remarkable picture.",

She was still young, but her slightly pock- marked countenance showed the wear and tear of sorrow of some kind. She had. indeed, lost her husband and her lather m the Montenegrin wars. Hastening forward to rleda she reached out a hand. \" Come with me,\" she said ; \" come and sleep in my tent to-night. To-morrow you shall go back to the Ry of Rvs perhaps.

I've plenty of it in my knapsack.\" \" Have you forgotten the Sentence of the Patrin ?\" Fleda asked the question in a voice which showed a sudden access of determination. \" He wiU have to wipe it out after to-morrow\" replied the other with a gleam of sulky meaning and furtive purpose in his eyes. \" If you mean that I will change my mind to-morrow, and be your wife, and return to the Gipsy Ufe. it is the thought of a fool.

Outside, the wedding song still made musical the night. Women's voices, shrill, and with falsetto notes, made the trees ring with it ; low, bass voices gave it a kind of solemnity. The view which the en-campment took of her captivity was clear. Where was the woman that brought her to the tent — whose tent it was? She seemed kind. Though her face had a hard look, surely she meant to be friendly. Or did she only mean to betray her; to give her a fancied security, and leave her to Jethro— and the night ? She looked round for some weapon. There was nothing available save two brass candlesticks. Though the door of the tent was closed, she knew that there were watchers outside; that any break for liberty would only mean defeat, and yet she was determined to save herself. As she tried to take the measure of the situation and plan what she would do, the noise of the music suddenly ceased, and she heard a voice, though low in tone, give some sort of command. Then there was a cry, and what seemed the chaotic noise of a struggle followed; then a voice a little louder speaking, a voice of someone she remembered, though she could not place it. Something vital was happening outside, something punctuated by sharp, angry exclamations; afterwards a voice speaking soothingly, firmly, prevailed ; and then there was silence. As she listened there was a footstep at the door of the tent, a voice called to her softly, and a hand drew aside the tent curtain. The woman who had brought her to this place entered. \" You are all safe now,\" she said, reaching out both hands to Fleda. \" By long and by last, but it was a close shave I He meant to make you his wife to-night, whether you would or no.

         "someone THE SECRET MAN He carries your father's voice —someone that you know, in his mouth.\" She stepped to the tent door and beckoned; and out of the darkness, only faintly lightened by the dying fires, there entered one whom Fleda had seen not more than nity times m her life, and never but twice since she had ceased to be a Romany. It was her father's secret agent, Khodo, the Roumelian, now grizzled and gaunt, but with the same vitality which had been his in the days when she was a little child. Here and there in the world went Rhodo, the voice of the Ry of Rys to do his bidding, to say his sav. No minister of a Czar was ever more dreaded or loved. His words were ever few, but his deeds had been many. Now, as he looked at Fleda, his old eyes gleamed, and he showed a double row of teeth, not one of which was imperfect, though he was seventy years of age. Would you Uke to come ?\" he asked. \"Would you like to come home to the Ry ? \" ou^i*^,*v'\"^ ^^\"^ ''\"\"S ''^\"^«\" \"P°n Wm. \"Rhodo I Khodo ! she exclaimed, and now the tears broke forth and her body shook with sobs. A few moments later he said to her: \" It's fifteen years since you kissed me last. I thought you were ashamed of old Rhodo. ' She did not answer, but looked a- uim with eyes stream- Ing, drawing back from him. Her embrace was astonish-ing even to herself, for as a child Rhodo had been a figure of awe to her, and the feeling had deepened as the years had gone on, knowing as she did his worlc throughout the world for the Ry of Rys. In his face was secrecy, knowledge, and some tragic underthing which gave him apart from his office, a singular loneliness of figure and manner. He was so closely knit in form; there was such concentration in face, bearing and gesture, that the isola- tion of his position was greatly deepened. \" No, you never kissed me after you were old",

She is a good woman ; she has suffered. Her people are gone, but she has a heart for others. I met her. She told me of what that rogue and devil had done and would do.

The landscape is not of the luscious kind; it has no close cor-respondence with a picture byCorot or Constable ; sunlight IS needed to give it the touch of the habitable and the homehke. It was, therefore, unfortunate for the spirits of the Lebanon people that the meeting summoned by local agitators to discuss with asperity affairs on both sides of the Sagalac should, while starting with fitful sunhght m the eariy morning, have developed to a bleak greyness by three o'clock in the afternoon, the time set for the meeting. Another strike was imminent in the factories at Manitou and in the railway-shops at Lebanon, due to the stupidity of the policy of Ingolby's successor as to the raUways and other financial and manufacturing interests. If he had planned a campaign of maladroitness he could not have more happily fulfilled his object. It was not a good time for reducing wages, or for quarrelling with the Town Councils of Manitou and Lebanon concerning assess-ments and other matters. November and May always found Manitou, as though to say, \" upset.\" In the former month, men were pouring through the place on their way to the shanties for their Winter's work, and generally celebrating their coming internment by \"irriga-tion;\" in the latter month, they were returning from their Winter's imprisonment, thirsty for excitement, and with",

         "a THE RETURN OF BELISARIUS 301 wet day it it apt to take shelter; on a bleak, grey day men are prone to huddle together in their anger with consequent stimulation of their passions. It was a grey enough day at Ubanon, and dark-faced visitors from Manitou felt the need of Winter clothing as they shiveringly crossed the Sagalac by Ingolby's bridge. The air was raw and searching; Nature was sulky. In the sharp wind the trees shook themselves angrily free of leaves. The taverns were greatly frequented, which was not good for Manitou and Lebanon. Up to the time of the meeting, however, the expected strike had not occurred. This was mainly due to the fact that Felix Marchand, the evil genjus of Manitou, had not been seen in the town or in the district for over a week. It was not generally known that he was absent because a man by the name of Dennis, whose wife he had wronged, was dogging him with no good intent. Marchand had treated the woman's warning viith contempt, but at sight of her injured husband he had himself withdrawn from the scene of his dark enterprises. His malign influence was therefore not at work at the moment. '^^ The tactics of the Lebanon Town Council had been careful and wise. So that the meeting should not be composed only of the roughest elements, they privately urged all responsible citizens to attend, and if possible capture the meeting for law and order and legitimate agitation. That was why Osterhaut, the town-crier, went about with a large dinner-bell announcing the hour of the meeting and admonishing all \"good folks\" to attend. No one had ever seen Osterhaut quite so cheerful— and he had a bonny cheerfulness on occasion — as on this grisly October day when Nature was very sour and the spirit of the winds was in a \" scratchy \" mood. But Osterhaut was not more cheerful than Jowett who, in a very un-dignified way, described the state of his feelings, on re-ceiving a certain confidence from Halliday, the",

Ppsently in the silence he half- tunied hu head, murmured something to the Chairman, and then got to his feet, stretching out a hand towards the crowd. For one moment there was silence, a little awe-stricken, a httle painful, and then as from one man a great cheer went up. For a moment they had thought him incon-siderate to come among them in this crisis, for he was no longer of their scheme of things, and must be counted out, a beaten, battered, blind bankrupt. Yet the sight of him on his feet was too much for them. Blind he might be, but there was the personality which had conquered them m the past— brave, adroit, reckless, renowned. None of them, or very few of them, had seen him since that night at Barbaion's Tavern, yet in spite of his tragedy there seemed Mttle change in him. There was the same quirk at the comer of the mouth, the same humour in the strong face, not so ruddy now; and strangely enough the eyes were neither guarded by spectacles, nor were they shiiinken, glazed, or diseased, so far as could be seen. Stretching out a hand Ingolby gave a crisp laugh and said: \"So there's been troi-bk- sLice I've been gone, has there ?\" The comer of his mouth quirked, his eyelids drooped in the old quizzical way, and the crowd laughed in spite of themselves. What a spirit he had to take it aU that way. \" Got a little deeper in the mire, have you, boys ?\" he added. \" They tell me the town's a frost just now. but it seems nice and warm here in the sun. Yes, boys, it's nice and warm here among you all— the same good old crowd that's made the two towns what they are.

         "!\" CHAPTER XXiy AT LONG LAST Originally the Catholic church at Manitou had stood quite by itself, well back from the river, but as the town grew its dignified isolation was invaded and houses kept creeping nearer and nearer to it. So that when it caught fire there was general danger, because the town possessed only a hand fire-engine. Since the first settlement of the place there had been but few fires, and these had had pretty much their own way. When one broke out the plan was to form a long Une of men, who passed buckets of water between the nearest pump, well, or river, and the burning building. It had been useful in incipient fires, but it was child's play in a serious outburst. The mourn-ful fact that Manitou had never equipped itself with a first-class fire-engine or a fire-brigade was now to play a great part in the future career of the two towns. Oster- haut put the thing in a nutsheU as he slithered up the main street of Lebanon on his way to the manning of the two fire-engines at the Lebanon fire-brigade station. This thing is going to link up Lebanon and Manitou like a trace-chain,\" he declared with a chuckle. \" Every-thing's come at the right minute.

There was a defect in the furnace, the place had caught fire, and some of the wooden flooring had been burnt before the aged Monseigneur Lourde dis-covered It. It was he who had given the alarm and had rescued the silver altar-vessels from the sacristy. Manitou offered brute force, physical energy, native athletics, muscle and brawn ; but it was of no avail. Five hundred men, with five hundred buckets of water would have had no effect upon the fire at St. Michael's Church at Manitou; wilhng hands and loving Christian hearts would have been helpless to save the building without the scientific aid of the I^banon fire-brigade. Ingolby. on founding the brigade, had equipped it to the point where it could deal with anv ordinary fire. The work it had to do at St Michael s was critical.

Lebanon took command of the whole situation, and for the first time in the history of the two towns men worked together under one control like brothers. The red-shirted nver-dnver from Manitou and the lawyer's clerk from Ubanon ; the Presbyterian minister and a Christian brother of the Catholic school; a Salvation Army captain and a black-headed Catholic shantyman; the President of the Order of Good Templars and a switchman member of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament slaved together on the hand-engine, to supplement the work of the two splendid engines of the Lebanon fire-brigade- or else they climbed the roofs of houses, side by side to throw on the burning shingles the buckets of water handed up to them. For some time it seemed as though the church could not be saved. The fir? had made good headway with the flooring, and had also made progress in the chancel and the altar. Skill and organization, combined with good luck, conquered, however. Though a portion of the roof was destroyed and the chancel gutted, the church was not beyond repair, and a few thousand doUars would put it nght. There was danger, however, among the smaUer houses surrounding the church, and there men from both towns worked with great gallantry. By one of those accidents which make fatality, a small wooden house some distance away, with a roof as dry as wool, caught fire from a flying cinder. As everybody had fled from their own homes and shops to the church, this fire was not noticed until it had made headway. Then it was that the cries of Madame Thibadeau, who was confined to her bed m the house opposite, were heard, and the crowd poured down towards the burning building. It was Gantry's \" caboose.\" Gautry himself had been among the crowd at the",
         "church, AT LONG LAST 311 As Gautry came reeling and plunging down the street, someone shouted, \" Is there anyone in the house, Gautry ?\" Gautry was speechless with drink. He threw his hands up m the air with a gesture of maudlin despair, and shouted something which no one understood. The crowd gathered like magic in the wide street before the house— the one wide street in Manitou— from the roof and upper windows of which flames were bursting. Far up the street was heard the noisy approach of the fire-engine, which now would be able to do little more than save adjoining build-ings. Gautry, reeling, mumbling and whining, gestured and wept. A man shook him roughly by the shoulder. \" Brace up, get steady, you damned old geezer ! Is there anybody in the house ? Do you hear ? Is there anybody in the house ?\" he roared. Madame Thibadeau, who had dragged herself from her bed, was now at the window of the house opposite. Seeing Fleda Druse passing beneath, she called to her. \" Ma'm'selle, Fehx Marchand is in Gantry's house drunk,\" she cried. \" He'll bum to death— but yes, bum to death.\" In agitation Fleda hastened to where the stranger stood shaking old Gautry. \" There's a man asleep inside the house,\" she said to the stranger, and then all at once she realized who he was. It was Dennis Doane, whose wife was staying in Gabriel Druse's home: it was the husband of Marchand's victim. \" A man in there, is there ?\" exclaimed Dennis. \" Well, he's got to be saved.\" He made a rush for the door. Men called to him to come back, that the roof would fall in. In the smoking doorway he looked back. \" What floor ?\"\" he shouted. From the window opposite, her fat old face lighted by the blazing roof, Madame Thibadeau called out, \" Second floor 1 It's the second floor",

As Dennis said, 1 can't get the hang ol It, but I'll try— I'll try.\" The burning of Gautry's tavern had been conquered, though not before it was a shell; and the houses on either side had been saved. Lebanon had shown itself masterful m organization, but it haa also shown that that which makes enemies is not so deep or great a thing as that which makes friends. Jealous, envious, narrow and bitter, Manitou had been, but she now saw Lebanon in a new light. It was a strange truth that if Lebanon had saved the whole town of Manitou, it would not have been the same to the people as the saving of the church. Beneath everything in Manitou— beneath its dirt and its drunkenness, its irresponsibility and the signs of primeval savagery which were part of its life, there was the tra- dition of religion, the almost fanatical worship of that which was their master, first and last, in spite of all— the Church. Not one of its citizens but would have turned with horror from the man who cursed his baptism ; not one but would want the last sacrament when his time came. Lebanon had saved the Catholic church, the temple of their faith, and in an hour was accomplished what years had not wrought. The fire at the church was out. A few houses had been destroyed, and hundreds of others had been saved. The fire-bngade of Lebanon, with its two engines, had per-formed prodigies of valour. The work done, the men marched back, but with Osterhaut sitting on one fire- engine and Jowett on the other, through crowds of cheer-ing, roaring workmen, rivermen, shantymen, and black- eyed habitants.

What had hap-pened between that time and this day of fate for Lebanon and Manitou ? It is not a long story, and needs but a brief backward look. This had happened : The New York expert performed the operation upon Ingolb/s eyes, announced it successful, declared that his sight would be restored, and then vanished with a thousand dollars in his pocket. For days thereafter the suspense was almost more than Fleda could bear. She grew sud-denly thin and a httle worn, and her big eyes had that look of yearning which only comes to those whose sorrow IS for another. Old Gabriel Druse was emphatic in his encouragement, but his face reflected the trouble in that of his daughter. He knew well that if Ingolby remained bhnd he would never marry Fleda, though he also knew well that, with her nature, almost fanatical in its con-victions, she would sacrifice herself, if sacrifice was the name for it. The New York expert had prophesied and promised, but who could tell ! There was the chance of failure, and the vanished eye-surgeon had the thousand dollars in his pocket. Two people, however, were cheerful; they were Ingolby and Jim. Jim went about the place humming a nigger melody to himself, and twice he brought Berry the barber to play to his Chief on the cotton-field fiddle. Nigger",
         "317 us THE WORLD FOR SALE Jim, though It was two generations gone which linked him with the wilds of the Gold Coast, was the slave of lanatical imagination, and in Ingolby's own mind there was the persistent superstition that all would be well because of a dream he had had. He dreamed he heard nis dead mother's voice in the room, where he lay. She had called him by name, and had said, \" Look at me, Max, and he had replied, \" I cannot see,\" and she had said again. Look at me, my son!\" Then he tiought that he had looked at her, had seen her face clearly, and it was as the last time they parted, shining and swwt and good. She had said to him in days long gone, that if she could ever speak to him across the Void, she would; and he had the fullest belief now that she had done so. So it was that this dreadnought of industry and organiza-tion, in dock for repairs, cheerfully awaited the hour when he would be launched again upon the tide of work- healthy healed and whole. At last there came the day vjen, for an instant, the bandages could be removed. There were present, Rockwell. Fleda, and Jim-Jim, pale but gnnmng, at the foot of the bed; Fleda, with her bwk against the door and her hands clenched behind her as though to shut out the invading world. Never had her hwrt beat as it beat now, but her eyes were steady and bnght. There was in them, however, a kind of pleading look She could not see Ingolby's face; did not want to see It when the bandages were taken off; but at the critical moment she shut her eyes and her back held the door, as though a thousand were trying to force an entrance. The first words after the bandages were removed came from Ingolby. •' Well, Jim, you look all right I\" he said. Swaying as she went, Fleda half-blindly moved towards a chair near by and sank into it. She scarcely heard Jim's reply.",

Intellect must find its play through the senses, be vitaUzed by the elements of physical life, or it could' not prevail. There was not one sensual strain in him, but with a sensuous mind he loved the vital thing. He was sure that presently Gabriel Druse would disappear, leaving her behind with him. That was what he meant to ask her to-day— to be and stay with him always. He knew that the Romanys were gathering in the prairie. They had been heard of here and there, and some of them had been seen along the Sagalac, though he knew nothing of that dramatic incident in the woods when Fleda was kidnapped and Jethro Fawe vanished from the scene. As Fleda came towards him, under the same trees which had shieldeiJ her from the sun months ago— now nearly naked and bare— something in her look and bearing sharply caught his interest. He asked himself what it was. So often a face familiar over half a hfetime perhaps, suddenly at some new angle, or because, by chance, one has looked at it searchingly, shows a new expression, a new contour never before observed, giving fresh signifi-cance to the character. There was that in Ingolby's mind, a depth of desire, a resolve to stake two lives against the chances of Fate, which made him look at Fleda now with a revealing intensity. What was the new thing in her carriage which captured his eye ? Presently it flashed upon him— memories of Mexico and the Southern United States; native women with jars of water upon their heads; the erect, well-balanced form; the sure, sinuous movement; the step measured, yet free; the dignity come of carrying the head as though it were a pillar of an Athenian temple, one of the beautiful Caryatides yonder by the Mgean Sea. It smote him as a sudden breath of warm air strikes a face in the night coolness of the veldt. His pulses quick-ened, he flushed with the soft shock of it. There she",

A half-hour later, as they wandered back to the house he suddenly stopped, put his hands on her shoulders, looked earnestly in her eyes, and said: \" God 's good to me. I hope I'll remember that.\" \" You won't be so blind as to forget,\" she answered, and she wound her fingers in his with a feeling which was more than the simple love of woman for man. \" I've got much more to remember than you have,\" she added.

Suddenly, however, he seemed to tower over her, his two big hands were raised as though they would strike, and then the palms spread out and enclosed her cheeks lovingly, and his eyes fastened upon hers. \" I know,\" he said gently. \" I always understood— everything; but you'U never have the same fight again, because I'll be with you.

Fleda had whispered to him in such awe, not only because he was her father, but because he was so much a man among men, a giant, with a great, lumbering mind, slow to conceive, but moving in a large, impressive way when once conception came. To her he had been mote than father; he had been a patriarch, a leader, a viking, capable of the fury of a Scythian lord, but with the tender-ness of a peasant father to his first child. \"MyRy!
