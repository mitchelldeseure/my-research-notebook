         "-'j5^v PREFACE Having been requested by many of my friends to collect and publish in book form my various con-tributions to the Public Press, I have endeavored in the present volume to meet their wishes. Although a thought or a sentiment might very often be better expressed in prose than verse, still it is not so likely to catch and rivet the attention of a casual reader, and many quotations now \"Familiar in our mouth as household words,\" would probably never have attained their present popularity had they been embodied in a speech or newspaper paragraph. As many of the poems in this volume have been read and met the approval of various people in high positions, well qualified to judge, I think no apology is needed for offering them to the general public, although the material may not have the culture or polish of the high-class magazine. I would express my thanks to the Editors of the Montreal Standard, Toronto Saturday Night, Mail and Empire, Star, News, and Telegram, of Toronto, for their courtesy in giving prominent position to my efforts. I also owe a debt of deep gratitude to one who, unfortunately, is past receiving my",

Alone, thou rolled the forn. n back In ignominious flight. The \"God of Battles\" nerved thy hand. Thou battled for the right. But now, when triple foes assail. No friend in sight you see.

They reaped a goodly harvest there Of women and children and babes, Shot down at their peaceful breakfast hour, Shot down near the sad sea waves; For the Kaiser had said, \" It's only by terror We can make these English see their error.\" They tackled a fort at Hartlepool town, But it proved a hard nut to crack; \"Discretion's the best part of valor,\" they said, \"'Tis not likely we'll ever come back.\" So they sailed on to Whitby, a small fishing port, Where the danger was less and they wouldn't get caught. They got back in safety to Germany's shore, And bragged they'd suffered no loss.

SMALL EVENTS We smile at the small events in life and think they're of no avail. We take no stock of the little things, except as an idle tale; But great events from small ones spring, although we pay no heed. For a word or a thought if acted on to great eve its may lead. Since Eve's temptation and the fall, and banishment from the garden, When a thoughtless deed without excuse shut out all hopes of pardon; Many great events in history, perhaps repented when too late. Have made or marred a destiny, or sealed a nation's fate. W^ ^« \u003c«WIIIM'\u003c",

ROUGH DIAMONDS Far away in a distant Yukon camp lived an emigrant called Joe, Who had left his home in England some eighteen months ago; Wandering, he struck this mining camp, a dreary place and cold, But what will man not venture in search of hidden gold. The luck had been against him, he never made his pile, Got just sufficient of the dust to make another trial; Always hoping for the best, he labored hard and long. Kind providence had blessed him with a constitution strong. His mates were hardy miners, \"diamonds in the rough,\" For mining in the Yukon makes men both hard and tough; Joe was a kind of favorite, not one who liked to roam. He laughed and joked like other men, but never spoke of home.",

Humorous THE MERRY WIDOW HAT Down below in the nether regions Was an Imp in sad disgrace; He was sent from his master's presence And told not to see his face, Until ht'd redeemed his prestige And invented some dark deep plot, Whereby mankind would be tempted — What it was, he cared not a jot. Now this Imp was deep and crafty, (He was versed in mystic lore), There was lots of plans that he thought of, But they'd all been tried before.

Which was said to be jjerfectiou in the very highest form ; \"i^was all about Ckthsemane and trees with boughs like snakes, That writhed and mocked the wanderer and filled his heart with quakes. I thought so long my eyes grew dim, the subject was too deep, And then tired nature succoured me and sent me off to sleep. And in my sleep T dreamed a dream, like Bunvan in the jad.

         "m 134 POEMS FROM THE PRESS I thought the poets from ofT my shelves had come again to life, Contended which could write the best, and then to end the strife, Each sent a copy of the poem, he thought his very best, To a \" Literary Editor\" for a thorough searching test. They scorn'd to strive for any prize, but only wished to see How a modern editor could judge, from prejudice set free, They gave a \"pen name\" with their work, in order that each might On equal terms stand side by side and so be judged aright. The \"Song of a Shirt\" was sent by Hood who thought it was his best, But the editor soon jumped on him and set his mind at rest, \"The Poem\" he said, may merits have, but the writer plainly lacks That humor without which all poets are literary \"hacks.\" Then Longfellow sent the \"Psalm of Life,\" said the critic sharp and terse, \"The pulpit is the place to preach, you should not preach in verse; \"The Queen of the May,\" by Tennyson, fared no bet-ter than the rest, 'Twas common-place repetition, and lacking vim and zest.

When he sent \"John Gilpin's\" matchless ride with others to compete; But the censor only used long words, to heights sub-lime he rose, And said the poem was silly stuff, much better said in prose. Felicia Hemans and Eliza Cook fared no better than the rest, They'd no emotional harmony to say the very best; Poetic instinct they had none, their verse was out of tune, Their lines, in fact, were out of place, like a fall of snow in June. At last with stanzas from Don Juan, came Byron, loved of Greece, He had been reviewed before, he said, but it did not hurt his peace; The editor asked him to \"re- write some parts that were obscure. And in different guise no doubt the verse, would some attract much more.\" But the bard was wiser than the judge, he knew the public best, And certain limits he must keep, although he loved a jest; So he laughed aloud, for it struck him 'twas a very pleasant joke, He laughed so loud and heartily, I from my slumber",

May his \"Fellowship\" spread although he is dead, And the little ones have all our pity. And hearts that would sever come closer together In hamlet, in town and in city. IN MEMORIAM (Gen. Booth.

We may find them on history's pages. There are men who have given their youth and their strength, In endeavoring to make us their debtor; Turning night into day till their hair has turned grey, But the world has been never the better. There are some who have given up friendship and love To work in a far distant field. Where burning sun glows, or amidst winter snows, Their courage sustained by their zeal; But the one who has striven God's blessing to gain, Is he who is doing his best; In the station in which ■ d has called him to live. For his efforts wiL , be blessed. Such a one was Tom Pinch, the gentle and mild, Although he was not blessed with beauty; He was rugged and good and on honor he stood, When he sacrificed love to his duty.

Though friends may desert us and fortune take wing. And death takes our loved ones away.

As the maid looks up to that sad, calm face. So full of strength, of love and grace, Her courage comes back again ; \"I fear nought when I hold your hand,\" she said, Not the cursing crowd or the guillotine red. For such as I Christ rose from the dead. And surely He died not in vain.\" She was cheered by the courage of him at her side. So gently he spoke while he took the dread ride. To the scaffold to lay down his life ; \"It will soon be over, fear not,\" he said.

Then he knew that his life to others so dear, Which he now laid dow^n without tremor or fear, Brought pardon to him from ^n high; That the man he had saved and she his fond wife. Far away in a land free from carnage and strife. Would sorrow for him to the end of their life, And speak of his fate with a sigh. A KITCHEN SHOWER We send these little gifts to you.

Trusted and loved by young and old. His was a household name.

All rise and sing, with heart and voice. The song— \"God Save the King.\" 'Tis said when the good ship Birkenhead, Sinking low in the angry waves, With troops drawn up on the slippery deck, As though they were on paratle; 'Tis said that the last sound from that ship, And sang with a hearty ring. Was the song a soldier knows so well. The song— \"God Save the King.\" When Major '' Json, in Africa, By the Matabelee pressed. No succor near and every hope Gone from each manly breast. The natives said from that dying band (Whose souls were on the wing), Their parching throats rang out in song, '^hat song — \"God Save the King.\" Then why in our theatres and concert halls, When the well-known strain is played, Should we treat our Anthem with disrespect, And no courtesy be",

Across the way the sun is shining. And its warmth brings hope and cheer. Why in gloom should we continue. Let us quickly then decide. Not to lir 'er in the shadows, But to choose the sunny side. When misfortune overtakes us. And the clouds are dark and drear, Look out for the silver lining, It is present never fear.

Not till he died we felt his loss and miss'd his cheerful face, It seemed to us that in the world there was a vacant place ; There are clever men in plenty, successful men in scores.
