         "THE OctoberNumber FOUR EARLY CANADIAN JOURNALISTS By WILFRED CAMPBELLo LL.D. Here is a chapter of biographical history neyer before touched upon. Dr. Campbell lias selected tbe most formative period in our national development-1 837 to 1867-and lie sketches the journalistie careers of four men who took part in mouldîng national sentiment at that time; Hugh Scobje, a Scotsman, founder of The Beitîsk Colonist; J. Sheridan Hogan, an lrishman, successor of Scohie as Editor of Thke Colonist; Brown Chamberlain, an Englishman, Editor of The Gazette, Montreal, and later Queen's Printer at Ottawa; and John Lowe, a Canadian, who was associated with Chamiberlain on The Gazette. This essay reveals personalities little known by even close students of Canadian history. In- teresting sidelightsare cast, particularly by the intimacy sliown to have existed between Hogan and Sir John A, Macdonald. THE OVERLAND LOYALISTS By W. S. WALLACE. This îs another chapter of Canadian history, a result of original researchi. A goo.d deal is known about those Loyahiets who went b\u003e' slip to England or Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but net so mucli is known about the colonization efforts of Colonel Allan Maclean, .Colonel Guy' Johinson, and Sir John Johnson and of those who came on\u003e Haldimand's invitation to settle at Isle aux Noix, Sackett's Harbour, Oswego, and Niagara, A GLORIOUS FOURTH By CHARLES STOKES. The strife bctween a Canadian and an American settler in the West over the flying of the Stars and Stripes is the basis of quite as amusing a stor\u003e' as \"The Calgary' Venus,\" whicli Mr. Stokes con- tributed te the August number. The fifth and concluding Adventure of Aniwar Ali, b\u003e' Madge Macbeth, is the best of the series. Don't miss \"The Bats of Meydurn,\" the fifth stor\u003e' of'the series by Sax Rohmer.

         "THE CANADIAN MAGAZINE countenance was grave, his foreliead large and beautifult, and his eye alert and sparkling until lie died. Certain- ly no one lias ever lived who fulfilled more completely the description of the epithet 'All mind and no body,' than this man of Kojnigeberg. During his ]lfe and ever since his death this etrange man lias been not- ed for the eccentrie., old maidenieli regularity and precision of his daily manners and habits of life. Every daily duty, wliether large or sil, was. done with the regularity of machinery. Rleine said of hlm. that the catheral elock of K6nigsberg did cot performn its daily task more dis- passionately and punctually than its counitryman. Every morning at the ceil of hie servant, whetlier in suimer or winter, lie rose promptly et five of the dlock. ile did not eat any break- fast but, having dreesed himself, smnoked one fuill pipe of tobacco and drank two cups of tea. 11e would have preferred coffee, but found it overlieating, and so was content m-ith the milder beverage. Although lie was a man of unusually tenmperate habits, lie is said, too, to have been fond of a regular glass of rum. Froni seven to ten o'elock in the forenoon the. Professor, for suci lie wus, lectured in the ueiglibouring University of Kënigsberg to some of the mnost distinguislied students wlio have ever Iistened to\u003e any teaclier. Nominally lie was known as the Pro- fessor of Philosopliy, but beaides lec- turing regularly on ethies and meta- physice, lie also lectured on mathe- maties, physies, astronomy, natural theology, physical geography, antliro- pology and fortification. H1e was in- deed \"Ein Prof essor der AUlerlei- Wissenschaf t, or, as we sliould say in English. a Professor of aIl things in general. \" At ten o'clock in the morn- iîng, lectures over, he returned to hie study, and there ln the manner of the truc college professor lie spent ex- actly three hours of diligent work preparing his lectures for the follow- ing day. The professer 'e dinner hour is ftfteen minutes after one, and as hie dinner is really hie only ineal in t le twenty-four hours, lie îs reselved to make it something of a feasx Hle is a college professr, a German collage profeesr,' of e type happily net yet wholly extinct ln Europe, a really great man and recoguized as sucli. After the custom of great mnen, there- fore, lie usually lias e few men of travel and learning and one or more ceunisellors of state Wo dine with him.

Conselous of hie acknowledgedl intel- lectuel preëmninence the Prof essor frequently indulges iu monologue. Perlip e i l a Swedeniborgien. At any rate, lie seeme smtrangely moved by many stories of tlie wouderful powers of the greatest iystie wlio lias ever lived, Swedenborg. ile relates to hie gueists, for example, thait etory of how Swedenborg et Giotlieniburg saw the fire whicli was raging at Stock- hlm and tlireeteuilg hie own dweil- ing, end liow, efter anixiously wetch- ing it for several. hours, lie suddenly composed himsef and remarked that thie fira lied stopped et a certain build- mng. All of whicli subsequently preved Wo be exactly true just as Sweden- borg lied sean it two liundred and fifty miles away. Or, perliepa, lie re- lates that other story of Swedenborg and the Princess.

Se se sent for Swedenborg and when lie lied come Wo sec lier she deputed him to deliver a secret message Wo the. soul of one of lier late departed and Iamented friende.

         "THE ORIGINAL PROFESSOR TEUFELSDROCKII credulous tone of voice, \"have you delivered mny message?\" Swedenborg stooped down and whispered some- tbinig in lier car whieh sent a cill through hier rnarrow bones. What lie had reported was true, ahe aaid, and eould ontly have been told to huîn by tire dead. Arion, the conversation turne to more serious and scientifie subjects. Perliaps the learned host entertains his distinguished gueste by hie, tlieory of the origin and development of the inaterial world. According to this theory hie elaims that the entire nma- teriai universe exieted at the begin- ning in the forma of a single vast nebula or dust-eloud of material par- ticles or atomas fot unlike what astron- orners knlow thle Milky Way to be at the presvnrtif ln. AS these Mtoins possess the iiiherent power of attraction and so gi-adiually intove towards a common centrie of gr-avity, they neeasarily be- corne condensed into solid masses and tend to assume a spiuing or rota- tory motion both around their own axes and around one another ini their respective orbits, and thua in the course of ages, worlds, planets satel- lites, aunas, cornets, meteors, and whole solar systemns corne into being. lie alec points out that by more physical lawe thie pr-oceas of moving toward a commion centre will necessarily iii course of tinie corne to, assume the opposite direction, and thus ail these heaventlyý bodies, including our own solid earth, wvill ultirnately return to, their original nebular condition, only to risc again Phoenix-like fran' their sles, aud so repeut the process again, time after time, cycle after cycle, until the last syllable of re- corded timne. Students of speculative physica will at once recognlize this thcory as the well-known. Nebular Ilypothesis usually attributcd by thcrn to Laplace. As a matter of fact Laplace onily wrote a few pages on the Nebular Hypothesis, whereas the philosopher of Kiônigsberg had writ- ten a whole treatise on the subject forty ycars earlier. Students of rnod- ern philosophy will also recognize this theor-y as substaîîtially the thoery of Cosilie Evolution proclaimed in recent years by Herbert Spencer, Hluxley, and Hlaeckel. Inlike Liaplace and these others, however, the subject of this sketch is in nio wiïse disposed to claim the credit of firet proposing this hypothesis to the learned world, for lie points out that aIl the salient outlineýs of the theory were fully elab- crated in the first century A.D. by the Roman poet Lucretius in his great poemn De Rierum Natura and that Lucretiue in turu gathered themn frorn speculationa in natural philosophy well-kniown to the philosophera of Italy and Greecc for- several centuries before the Chrisian crse'. \",And is it not trn ,\"the Profes- sor remiarksiagainj,'\"thlat aorigto the firat dhapter of the book of Gene- sis the Almiighity should. have created the liglit on the firast day and the suni, miooni and star-s ou the fourtIl day of the creative week'\" A\\nd yet, lie contends, that is not wholly incered- ibie on atrictl.y scientific grounds, for ligh.t, illumination, visibility is essentially different f rom thc white liglit of the sun or of the suns' raya on a brîglit summer day. The opposite of liglit îs not darkness, for the face of darkneee itself muet be illuninrated in order to be aeen. The opposite of lighit is visible nothing- ness. Blind men do not; see darkness; they do not sec anything. To thec blind mani physical objecta are lie objeta bchind our backs; for the eye they aimiply do not exist. If darknesa and the white liglit of physical science were opposites wve should only sc a white acren i front of our eyes in the day as we sýec a dark screen ini front of our eyes in the niglit. What thenl is liglit, illumination, visibility? la it an attribute iherent in material objecta in space? «Or iuay it not rather bie the minds' own inherent power of secing objecta through the e 7l May flot thc material, world of carth and moon and suni and stars be essentially like the blind mani s world",

We van only mention a few of hlie mue0t preguant saying-s in order, if may be, te indieàte hie main position and hie influence upen Carlyle. \"Two things strike mie dlumtb\" says Kýant, ''the starry heavens above iniy head and the moral law wvithin mie.\" Kant ia net a mnystie, nor a nature worshipper, inuch less a mnaterialist. Ile begines lby placing the humiiani per- sonlailty, the Me that knows, -wills and doce on at Ieast an equal and e-ordin- ate plane with the material universe. In any real world whicli can be lcnewni, knewn and knower, subjeet and eh.ject, Ego and Non-ege, must be nt least of equal importance. Mlag- nify the starry heavene as mauch as you may, yen are still paying un- conscieus reverence te the Iittle mmid, the thinking Mle, which essaye te com- prehiend ite vastriess, te mark its courses, and te understand semne of its miysteries. -Marvel at the mystery'N and the power of the mnaterial werld as mnuch as yen may, yen are etill but paying tribuite to'the mind which bas the sense to mnarvel at it and eau say; 'Universe, stand thon there, while I stand here, te understand Thee, te test Thee, te prove Thee, te diseover of what matter 'Thou art made and to knew the laws which govern Thy many and mysterious chaniges. '\" Indeed Kant would. go eveni further than this. The eliglitest observation shows at once, lie saye, that the moral personality, the willing aud doing Me, stands on a higlier plane thani the physical Universe. The physical Unîverse inierely is, wlîereas the Me proclaimes what ought to be, and inasmucli as what ouglit te be is nlecessarily higher thian what merely ie, the moral Me is nucessarily higlier in nature than the physical world. The higheet realities a re moral realîties, the meet ultimiate reality is the human moral, personality; the highest law of beiug, the law of duty, the law of deing. \"Well, said Saint Chrysoetom, with hie lips of gold, 'thie true Shekinah ie man'\" Suchi seemes te have been the ruling ides of Kauit's life aud of hie philese- phy. Iu bis great work l'le Critique of l'ue Reason, however, lie goes machl further thani we have ststed. In that werk, after tirst deploring, like Teufelsdriiekh, \"that ail miets- physies had hitherto proved se inex- pressibly upiredluctive,\" lie boldly ventures the hypothesis which, as we have seen, he hand long enter- tairied aud discussed with hie friends, that the enly physical or natural world which we really know is in reality a construction of the thiuk- ing Me. Or, ini the words of Biehop Berkeley, \"The whole choir of heaven and furniture of earth have ne subsietence without a think- ing inid, there beiêg is Io bc known, their esse is percipi'.\" Or, in Ksnt'e own worde, \"Uuderstanding miakes nature\"; \" Verstand nat iir gemack t.\" To the untraiued reader, ne deuibt, these words are whelly meaninglees. Nevertheless, aud that even if we de not agree with Kant's phîlosophy, there is ne denying the faet that these three words are prebably more preg- nant with wit and wisdom than any otber three words whichi have ever been written. le it net strauge, for example, that each one e! us stands in the middle of hie own universel",

It doea not recog- nize its inother's voice, ta it the 8weetest voiee that earth has ever heard.

But how then, you will ask, if each of our underatandings inakei its own world, do we ail make the samne or siinilar worlds? The answer is very simple. Not primarily because al our worlds are thue saine, but because our linderstaindings are the saine and, therefore, work i the saine way. And our understandings are the samne be- cause they are ail fashioned after the pattern of the Infinite Understand- ing which created theni and through which they live and grow continuialiy. We are ail sons of Od and like liiji. We are spiritually mnade in Ilis image. We do not think that we need go further to prove that tht, Philosophy of Clothes la the Philosophy of Ger- man Idealismu inaugur-ated by lim- manuel Kant The, lhilosophy of Clothes îs the phîlosophiy wh1ich resta upon Kant 's primnary assumption that understanding nakes niature.

If final proof be needed, Carlyle haLs expressly Lold uls so. In \"i\u003erosp)ective,\" ciluapter eleven, book one, he writes: -Thus in this one pregnant subject of clotes rlghtly uniderstood, la includ- ed ail that men have thoughit, dream- ed, dloue and been; the whole exter- nal universe and whiat it, holds is but elothing; snd the essenve of all sci- ence lies in the P'hulosophyv of Clothes. \" Neither, we tltink, nieed we go fur- fluer to prove that the real volume on Ciothes, Die, KleicZer, ihr Wede ind Wirkeu, la noue other than the Cri- tique of Pure Rea8on, Dîe Kritik der reinen Vernitibf .

That Carlyle read and thoroughly mastered Kant's phil- osophy xnay lie proved by a hundred evidences to the student alike of the sage of Chelsea and the sage of Kd- nigsberg. Differences, no doulit, there are between the two great books of these two great masters. The Cri- tique of Pure Reason le a very finely- woven and elaborately-fashioned work of systematie metaphysies; the Sartor Resartus î8 confessedly a patchwork of vivid, startling colours.

But if Kant's philosophy is the original Philosophy of Clothes, and, if the original Volume on Clothes la the Critique of Pure Reason, lei Im- manuel Kant, the author of the Cri- tique, the original Diogenes Teufels- drëeckh, the author of the Volume on Clothes? There are many evidenees that lie was. Both Kant and Teufels- drëeckh wrote epoch-msking books which inauguirated a new and strange philosophical movement in the Ger- man Fatherland. Both were prof es- sors of things in geueralinl German universities. Both were men of snnall physicai stature and bachelor recluses of eccentrie manners and of startling opinions.

BENHAM IT was iii the moon of flhe falling leaves thiat a young Sioux warrior, while hiunting amidst the foothille of eastern Montana, met two pale- faces on the trail. H1e had neyer seen themn at Fort Smith, Buford, or Ben- ton, and knewv them to be strangers on his huiiting-grounds. H1e at once approached them with his hand rais- ed in the salutation of friendship of his people, anid greeted them with the single, expressive inquiry, \u003c'Howl \" mieaning to ask as to their destina- tioni. The 'y spurned the proffered friend- slip of, the young redskin, either through mîstrust of his intentions or througli the belief in the old saying that \"the only good Indian îs a dead one, and in answer to hie cordial salutation they opened fire on him. Thte wanton attempt at murder fait- ed, but the first shot fired crashed in- to the head of the horse of the young Sioux. Ris escape front death was almost miraculous; and the murder- ous declaration of hostility changed him in an instant from a friend to an enemyv, with a Sioux vendetta which only blood would satisfy. With a war-whoop of defianee the Indian wheeled and galloped to safety ainidst the timber and ravines of the foot- bills, around -which he skirted in hie fliglit, pursued by hie two well-niount- ed assailants. Rlis pony, thougli fatal- ly wonnided, lad sufficient vitality to enable him to effeet his escape, whiel lie did by out-witting hie pursuers, 2-4.1\u003c thiroughi woodcraft, stealthi, and lu- diant wiles.

Thus within a short space of timne their relative positions were entirely chang- ed, and the hunters becamne the lunt- cd, with a wily. deteriined, ruthiess, and thorouglily incensed young sav- age in relenitiese pursuit. The quar- rel had been of their seeking; revenge remiained for him. WiÎthin a few hours the Indian's horse died, but he continued the pur- suit on foot. The incident, so far as the white men were concerned, was evÎdently soon forgotten, as a inere exciting episode; though their initial exertions in the fruitiess chase car- ried themn many miles in advance of thpir unmonnted enemy. 'When they realized lie lad esaped, theyý resumn- ed thieir journey leisurely, camping and cooking their meua as usual and sleeping as if ini safety. Meanwhile their ruthiess pursuer gradually gain- cd on them; and sustained only by a desire for revenge he neyer rested nor camped.

         "TUE CANADIAN MAGAZINE returned to his tribal tepee, guard- ing within his breast the gruesonie secret of his thrilling adventure and its bloody climax. That young Indian was Raîn-i- the-Face, who was destined to beeome a power in the eouneils of hie tribe, \"nd one of the greatest chiefs, war- riors, and orators his race lias pro- duced, The echo of the shot fred in the dastardly attempt upon his life by two swash-backling gun-men of the frontier, like the gun at Fort Sumpter, was heard around the world. It was the trifling spark which sxnouldered for xnany moons and ultimately set the Montana prairies on fire; for this incident was the real beginning of the trouble which culminated in the memorable uprising of Sitting Bull (Ho-Too-Ah- Okh-Hose) the irreconcilable, the in- veterate enemy of the white man, the liereditary chief and dominant power among the lJncpapa Sioux nation, who swept over the settlements like a scourge in the spring and summer of 1876. It was an outbreak which bathed Montana in blood, and had as its melancholy climax the massacre of General Custer and hie entire coin- mand, excepting \" Curley, \" the Crow Indian scout, on the banke of the Lit- tle Big Hru, on that ill-fated June nmoruing thirty-seven years ago. The unwritten pages of the history of that carnage, as reeordid in the traditions of the redmen, aud the inemnories of the frontier, unfold a story of draniatie interest centering around this unprovoked attack upon Rain-in-the-Face, and its sequel in his arrest on a charge of murdering the two unknown whites, six monthes afterwards. By a cruel decree of fate this charge was preferred againet him by Captain Tom Custer, a brother of the ill-starred general, who had been an unwelcome and uninvited guet at Wauhepai (Sun Dance, or Dance to the Greatest God) of Sitting Bull 's baud during the ensuing spring. Cus- ter took a solemn oath on hîs honour as a soldier and a gentleman, to, re- gard everything he saw and heard there as confidential anmd secret be- fore being allowed to attend this tri-. bal feast, which included the cere- mnony of \"making braves.\" He vio- lated this oath and betrayed the trust and confidence reposed in him by the Indians. This was an unpardonable offence in the eyes of the Sioux, by whom personal lionour was esteemed beyond life itself in such matters. Regardiess of whatever excuses msy be offered ini defence of the memory of Captain Tom Custer in this con- nection-his admitted devotion to duty, sud to the enforcement of law and justice as lie interpreted hiemi- this sct was construed by the indians as one of the grossest treachery of the pale-faces, and fixed the responesibil. ity for subsequent eveuts on him. It was this offence againet their code of lionour-the perjury of an unwelcome guest-and consequent indignity suf- fered by a respected member of their band, that aroused the Sioux niatîin to, wreak a terrible revenge on flic war-psth after summoning to their aid their equally ferocious kinsmien and allies, the Cheyennmes. However, poor Tom Custer, who unquestionably acted as conscience dictated in this unfortunate affair, paid the penalty with hie life; for lie died the death of a gallant soldier, with hie face to the foc, fightiug desi perately at the Little Big Horn.

It was ail in vain that Reynolds argued with hîm from every stand- point. fie knew that a revelation of the killing by the Captain would mean that hie personally would be branded by bis red-skinned friends as, a liar and a traitor to i trust, a mere renegade, worthy only of death. The scout pointed out that snob a position of affairs would de- stroy bis usefulness forever, as ît would change the entire associations of a lîfe-time in a moment. fie also wished to protect his own honour, which, like many a man of bis pe- culiar make-up, was more to him than life. Ail the bard pleadings and argu- menta, however, were in vain. Cap- tain Cuater was obdurate, and deter- mîncd to have the Indian murderer, as ho chose to eall hlm, properly pun- ished. Reynolds appealed to General Custer to listen to bis counsels in the interests of peace, friendship, and honour, and his own usefuines to the garrison. The general, however, took the vie-w of bis brother and deemed that the act of Rain-in-the-Face, in1- stead of branding hlm. as a hero to be 'worshipped, stainped himt as a erîninal of a dangerous'class. There- fore when Captain Ouster requested a detail of soldiers to effeet the ar- reat of Raîn-in-the-Face it was promptly placed atbis disposai. Cap- tain Ouater took command ln person and îmmediately returned to the camp of Sitting Bull, where hie foundi( Rain-in-the-Face enjoying bis glori- fiedT position and newly-found h on- ou rs with the blood fromn the skewers still.on bis back, and in no physical condition to resist arrest. The appearance of the soldiers up. ýon sucbe a mission created a furor-e in the camp, though the feelings we(re somiewbat suppressed for the time be- ing by the show of force. The In- dians, howcver, knew someone lad playedl the traitor and that the per.son was tIc young officer before tbem. fia fate was settled thjen and there. Thc arrest of Rain-in-the-Face is said not to have been effected in a very dîgnifled manner, but ln a way ealeulated to lcap indignity upon hlm and to impress the rest of b is band with the terrors of the law. Rie was thrown astride a pony with bis baek to the horses 'aead, the position of greatest degradation in whicl an Indian prisoner could be placed, and bis feet were ticd under its body. Thus was lie taken to Buford and placed in the celas of the fort, wlere lie remained for three months. At thc expiration of that time bie effeeted bis escape by tunnelling under the wall and fled back to has tribe, actu- ated by but one burning desire and that was revenge for the indignity beaped upon hlm. by \u003cJaptain Ouaster, fie found the band already planning vengeance on the whites, and prompt- ly took a lcading rôle. The runners were despatcbed to the Cheyennes, and soon the war dancing was in pro- gress'in preparation for the outbreak.

Among those presellt was Ohief Gall, and from hie lips was leamned for the first tirne the details of that carnage. It was only after a great deal of per- suasion that he was induced to relate the story, but when lie dîd undertake it lie told it with dignity and anima- tion in the following language, irhieli may be intereating now: ..We saw the soldiers early i the niorning crossing the divide. When Reno and Cu8ter separated we watcli- ed them until tliey came into the val- ley. Then the cry was raiaed that the white soldiers were coming, and or- ders were given for the village to inove immediately. Reno awept down on the upper end so s'wiftly that we were forced to fight there. Sitting Bull and I were in command at the point where Reno first attacked us. Sitting Bull was the Big Medicine 'Man. The women and children of thle village were hastîly despatched down the valley to whlere the Chey- enneî were encamped. We Sioux then attacked Reno, and the Oliey- enes charged upon Ouater, and then ail becamne mixed up. The squaws and chlîdren cauglit horses for the bucka to mount, and then wve mount- ed and charged upon Reno's soldiers. We checked hixn and flnally drove him back- into the timber. The sol- diers, liowever, tied their horses to trees there and returned and fouglit us on foot. We were flually auccesa- fui, and as aoon as Reno was beaten and driven across the river the wliole force turned on Ouater and fouglit him until they killed every one of bis soldiers. \"Ouater did not reacli the river, but was met about a half a mile up the ravine, at what is now called Reno Creek. We fouglit the soldiers and drove them back step by step until ail mere kiiled. [One of Reno 's of- ficers confirma this, saying, 'It iras probably during this iterval of quiet on Reno 's part that the Indiens mass- ed on Ouater and annihîlated him.]' We ran out of ammunition, and then used bows and arrows. We fired from behind our horses. The soldiers got sheila stuck in their guna [pistols]. We were in couples behind and in front of Ouater as he moved up the ridge to take a position, and were just as many as the blades of grass over irhiol lie was marching. The firat tiro companies [Keogh's and Calhoun 's] got off their horses and fouglit on foot. They neyer broke, but mere driven back step by step untl forced back to the ridge wlie ail were finaily killed. They were shot down i the lines whlere they stood.

As soon as a hoider of horses was killed, by waving blankets and doing a great deal of ahouting the liorses were stem- peded, wihl made it impossible for any of the soldiers to escape us.

We hiad the Ogalallas, Mineconjous, Brute, Teton, Uncpapas, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Grosventirvs with us. \"A fterwards when the big dust in the air came down the river [Terry and Gibbons's brigades march] we struck our lodges anid moved up a creek towards the Whiterain Moun- tains.

         "WHERE CANADA FAILS BY MRS. DONALD SHAW IN touching upon any points of Canadian life and character in a manner which is not wholly corn- ptirnentary, 1 arn aware that 1 arn laying inyseif open to the risk of bringing scathing and indignant de- utials down upon my devoted head. But I would ask those who read rny remarks to do s0 believing that there is no unkindness or adverse criticism intended. \"Lookers-on see rnost of the game\" is an old and tried truism; and sornetimes newcorners see things whieh are hidden frorn old residents. It is impossible for anyone to live in a country without formîng opinions of il, and a country which like the Dominion, is developing with extra- ordinary rapidity naturally presents phases of life and character entirely different from those one notices in established nations. It is curious te anyone who has lived for many years in England to diseover how tender are the suscepti- bilities of Canadians and, in fact, 1 think, any citizens of a new country, towards anything savouring of cri- ticism. Wein the \"old eountry\" are so accustomed to be critîcized that we should feel strange if we did net get it. Everyone who visita us has something to say about us, and gen- erally saya it very frankly, as do those who deal with Flnglish life and char- acter in their home papera and lit- erature. We, as wonien, are quite aware that American and Frenchi wo- men look upon us as being the worst dressed women in the world--our men-kind have long ago assimilated 4M4 the idea, that they are regarded as be- ing bumptious, insular, and conceit- ed. But these frankly expressed Opinions trouble us not one whit; in fact,' they amuse us. As'an instance of this I quote a case which occurred a couple of years ago. A well-known Canadian jour- nalist went over te London and sent back to his papers a series of articles i11 whidli le pulled us and our habits to shreds. He laughed at our chilly liouses, our heavy meals, our tbick tweeds, our tiny trains, our enormous sponges, and our small baflis. He was very amusing indeed at our expense, and no one was more amused over the articles, or admitted the truth of what lie said more readily than the Englisl people who read his remarks. 1 wrote a reply to one of these ar- ticles, whicl 1 sent te a London pa- per, in which I made somne retaliatory statements regarding national habits on this aide of the water, whereupon I think that every Canadian whose eye feli upon my harmless little ar- ticle promptly seized pen and paper, and wrote infuriated epistles saying that 1 was talking utter nonsense, and that Canadians were the most \"so- and-so and so-and-so people in the world. \" Not long ago I received a severe spanking from a gentleman who took umbrage at some very simple remarks 1 made about the state of education in some of the eastern Provinces of Canada, and he, informed me, in print, of course, with some consider- able heat, that I did not knowv whiat us",

It Îa presented ini varied modes and shapes. The papersi arc fulIl of it, particular- ly the United States papiers,' which are largely circulated in Canada. The Suniday editions reek with it, until one is almost forced to the conclusion that marriage instead of being the lufe-long companionship, in whîch the one takes the other \"for better or worse until death us do part\", is an experimental incident in the 11f e of a man and woman, to be dissolved at the pleasure of either party to the temporary arrangement In Canada, thanaka te the views of our legisiators of earlier days, the mnarriage tie la net easily severed, but, it can be sev- ered, aud it would appear that if the evidence necessary îs forthcomlug, advantage is freely aud frequently taken of it. The question, we are told, is about te be raised in the Dominion Parlia- ment, by a proposition to alter the law under which divorce is grauted lu the Provinces, other than the Mari- time Provinces and Britishi Coliubia, where there are divorce courts. It is quite certaiu that lu these Provinces by the sea, a change where- by the divorce courts would be abol- lshed aud the question referred te Parliament for adjudication would not be at ail welcomed. Individuals 4M5 may have and do have their opinions on this subject, most vital to the wel- fare of the state. Ou religious grounds a large section of the people do not believe in divorce at ail or, at least, unless on rare grounds sanctioned by the religîous body in which they be- lieve. Theological students are di- vided in their interpretation of the words of the Saviour, wheni He ap- pears to allow divorce where adultery luas been comitted. But there la scarcely any ground for the view that for any other cause, at ail events, this higli sanction can be invoked. It may flot be an altogether unmn- teresting contribution to the subject, te diseuse the law in regard te mar- nîage and divorce in the Province of New Brunswick. lu the firat place, it -will be well te remember that New Brunswick ia a Province, originally created by the Loyalists§-carved out of the large pre-boyalist Province of Nova Scotia. The Loyaliats brought with them their own views on thia most important question, and the law as it is to-day is essentially the same as it was when the first Act on the subject was passed iu 1791, as far as the causes for which marriage may be diasolved. It is interesting to note that in the original Act the ques- tions of marriage and of dissolvinig marriage were both deait with. At that time the Church of England was by law established. The solemmza- tion of matrimony was primarfly",
         "THE CANADIAN' MAGAZINE placed in the hands of clergymen of the established chureh, with import- ant provisos. When there was no sucli clergyman in auy parish or town, jus- tices of the peace of the quorum were authorized to perform the eereiaony according to, rites prescribed by the Governor-in-Coundil. Ministers of the Church of Scotland, and Quakers, and clergymen in Holy Orders of the Church of Rome were allowed to cele- brate marriages between persons of their respective communions. The question of such a marriage when the principals were of different religious belief s does flot; appea.r to, have been specially deait with, but as penalties are provided for those who celebrate inarriages without proper authoriza- tion, the iinference may bie drawn that a marriage of a mixed, nature miglit net have been held void, although per- formed by officiais with limited au- thority. It was not long before privileges te elerg1y of the Churchi of England were done away with, snd ministers of ail denominations were authorized te celebrate marriages between any Parties competent te enter into the contract. Se miuch fer the brief his- tory of the forni of marriage in New Brunswick. Thep Governor andi (ouncil or any five mnembers ef the Council together with the GPovenr were by the early Act eonstituted a Court of Judicature in matrimonial causes. The \u003cioverner eould deputize the Chief Justice or enle Of the judges te act in his place, but for xnany years te corne this tri- bunal Was to bie known as the Court of the Ooveruor-in-Council. In 1834 a change was made, when the Ezecu- tive and Legislative Council became separated, and it was prevideti that the Lieutenant-Governer and the Execuative Counceil, together with any judge of the Supreine Court, or the. Master of the Rails for the said Pro- vince, should ferin the court, andi it wus furtiier provided that the jîdge so named should be the vice-presideut of the court, and that lie, wvith any two members of the Executîve Cotin- cil, should lie a sufficient court. Tlhis. then was the Court for Matrimonial Causes for nearly thirty years. in 1860 the Act was passed under which the \"Divorce Court\" as at preseut constîtuted, was first established. Un- der tus legisiation ene of the judges of the Supreme Court was te, be ap- pointed the judge for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, which jurisdie- tien is stiil exercised, the judge of the Divorce Court being also eue of the puisne judges of the King's Bench. Some years ago,' very little came befere the Divorce Court, but the cases are multiplying rapidly, and many causes now corne up for con- sideration. The grounds upen whieh divorce \u003ca vinicuio matrt*nwnii may lie granted are set forth in exaetly the same wording as in the Act of George the Third of 1791. It will net lie amiss te quete them: \"The cause for divorce front the bond of matrimony and of dissolving and annulling marriage are and shal bie, f rigidity or impotence, adultery and consanquinity within the degrees prohibiteti in aud by an Act of Par- liament made in the thirty-secoud ycar of the reigu of Kiug Henry the. Eight, intituled. an Act for niarriages te stand notwithstanding pre-con- tracts, andi ne other causes whatse- ever.\"' There la aise another section derived from, the original Act, stili unrepealed, under whieh it is pro- vided that the issue of a maarriage dissolved for adultery shall not b. bastardized; uer the wife be barred of lier dower, or the husband of his tenancy by the courtesy of England unless expressly se adjudged by the. decee of divorce. Ailowing that divorce i. Wo be deait with Éy a seenlar tribunal, it la in every way better that the tribunal shoulti le a court of justie, in the ordiuary acceptation of the. word. For one reason there is the expense. If it lie right that a divorce bie granted, on a certain statement of facts, it is",
         "THE NEW BRUNSWICK DIVORCE COURT not riglit that the applicant should be prevented of his remedy by reason cf the cost to him. The doors of a divorce court should flot swing open at the toudli of the ricli man, and ro- main closed to the puali of the poor man. Surely Lazurus should have equal rights with Dives; Frapce may be looked to as an example i this. A divorce before that estimable body the Sonate of Canada, is said to be a most exp ensive process, even where the case is undefended. lu the New Brunswick Divorce Court a decree, where the case i.s undefended, may be obtained at an entire eost to the ap- plicant of from $150 te $200, and probably ini some instances for less. In fact, the expense would be about the sanie as ini au undefended Su- promo Court case, the focs as laid down being exceedingly moderato. So mudli for the question of expense. Now as te the tribunal itself. One, of the New Brunswick judges lai ap- pointed te deal with this subj oct. lRe is an officia who is trained in the con- sideration and weighing of evîdence, and holds a position in whidh lie las no other motive than to perform lis judicial functions creditably, unin- fluenced by either party to the action, quite removed from any good or harm either can do hlm. Surely sudh a court is better able to deal with the matter of a proposed separation of iuarried people than a legisiative body mnany of whom have no concep- tion of the laws of evidence, and who are not by any means uninfluenced by their party political affiliations. There la the riglit of appeal from the Divorce Court judgc, t the Supreme Court en banc. Tt mnay be said for New Brunswick that divorce is not popular. This cornes from the influence, stili feit, of the old Loyaliets, who made divorce difficuit te obtain on account of the few causes for which it would 'bo granted, and who, in their own ex- ample, had littie We do with lt. in thoso early days there were practie- ally no divorces, and the resuit was that marriage came te be looked up- on as a solemn matter, not to bo liglit- ly takon in hand and not to be easily broken when once ontered upou. So that even to-day divorce is. unpopu- lar, and until very recently, at any rate, the divoreo was net welcomed into social circlos. But gradually this healthy attitude is leus firinly maintained, and opposition to divorce is weakening. It is weakeuing with what we must ahl deeply deplore but cannet dispute, the waning of relig- ions influence. Whube suob a Divorce Court as ex- ists in New Brunswick is unquestion- ably the best for thc purpese, and while upon what are called Scrip- tural grounds only are divorcesf granted, there la a new dîfficulty i the path which in a measure threatens te unido ail the good that the strict- ness of the law lias wrought and te accomnpliali ail the evil that lt hau pro- vented. We are neit dloor te Maine, and] lt, people of Maine are the most charîn- inig of neiglibours, as keen in busi- ness as they are hespitk-b'le and charit- able in private if e. But they do net agree with us on the marriage and divorce question. With thom you, can get a divorce while, yon wait. Very easy indeed is it to get the bond cut, across the lie, and of late our young people who live close tW JUcle Sam's boundary have acquired the habit of seeking in Maine the relief they can. not get in New Brunswick. A time cornes in the hitherto happy life of the young xnarried, couple when things becomie mono tonons, when perhaps one or loth £ind they woiild prefor different mates. Neither is averse to divorce, but how ta get it is the ques- tion. The anstere court at F'rederic- ton would net listen t» the plea for a moment-ail the less, if collusion were in the air, for collusion when it shows its head in court damns the chances of an applicant. So easy to step aerose into Maine! Almost as easy te acquire a \" domicile. \" Domi- ciles in Maine are peculiarly easy",
         "THE GANADIAN MAGAZINE for parties seeking divorce decrees. The next step is a decee from the Maine court pronoiuieing the divorce, and then back again to the Provrince once more open to matrimonial pro- posais. When the neit marriage takes place, it generally lias to be \"isolemnized\" in the country where the divorce was granted, for minîsters on thisa ide are a bit shy as to the legality of the divorce so easily ac- quired. However, the newly-wed ex- pccts, and is not very oftèn disap- pointed, to be receîved into the social brotherhood together with the new mate-revised and iniproved. 0f course, this is au evasion of the law. 11ow eau it be that one eau leave ue 's own country, where the law will flot meet the case, to secure relief in a country where casier miles prevail? 13y and by, and probably not long hence, the Divorce Court of New Brunswick ivill be called upon to give a decision on these get-free- quick divorces, of which Maine is so prodigal. The question of property riglits will presently crop up, and it will be a question of \"who's whio.\" Even the shade of bigainy looins up ini the not far distance. This 'natter lias been dealt with briefly and, i~t is hoped, succinctly. While msziy colmnmuiglit be cuver- cd enougli has been said for the pur- poses of information. It will be not- ed that the Divorce Court was gradu- ally evolved. With the 'natter in the liands of the Governor-in-Council, as in the carlier days, there was a con- dition, not altogether unlîke that un- der which the Senate deals with the cases under its jurisfdiction. It was net untîl 1860 that the admirable change was made under which the present court exist. It is certaînly also a 'natter for congratulation that the \"causes\" remain unchanged, and one hears of no wish that the rea- sons for divorce be enlarged. Even with the restricted grounds there are many more cases than a decade ago, which cannot be accounted for by au increase ini population. Can it be ac- counted for hy the passing of that feeling ofdelicacy, which woiild en- dure great suffering rather than the airing of family dishonour in public? Or, front another viewpoint, are the genuine causes for divorce more pre- valent than years ago? Are husbands and wives less f aithful than cf yere 1 These are questions for the thinker to suIve as the facte prosent thie'- selves te him.

It was the post known as Fort Churchill. As Peter was a servant of the comn- pany at that tîme, it îs presumed that the papers formcd part of the pro- perty reseued by him from. the fautes, and not knowing their contents, nor realizing their vaine, which after al, la of a purely historicai nature, he negleeted Wo turn them intô appreeîa- tive hands. Queý paper, dated the year 1820, wus evidently part of a private journal belonging Wo Josiah Broadworth. It purposes to give the ~journalist 's conception of the real reasons why Governor Hearne, in 1782, surrendered the almost impreg- nable stronghold, Fort Prince of Wales, to the Frenchi Admnirai de la Pêrouse. This paper is now in the private archives of a prominent, Cana- dian statesman. At the mouth of the Churchill River, on Hudson Bay, near the six- tieth parallel of north latitude, stood the once proud Fort Prince of Wales.

This vast virgin territory is repre- sented only by a few traders, two outposts of the Northwest Mounted Police, less than haif a hundred white trappers, a rare prospector, and the swiftlYdiminshing numbers of the aboriginal redmen. In a word, it is four hundred and flfty miles froni civilization. \"Promi civlization?\" you ask. \"ls there flot a kind of settiement at Fort Churchill?'\" No, flot a kind of settlement-a set- tiemient of a kind. There is a smal trading-post of the Hudson s Bay Company, replacing the one that was burned during the service of our friend Peter, and an Indian mission. For seven months of every year both these are surrounded by ice and snowdrifts; the other five by swamp, bare granite, and insect pesis. These establishments are invisible froin the shores of the harbour and froin any vessel lying in the anchorage. Onïe ean aixnost be grateful for the ab- sence of woods of any description, whieh allows lhe police harracks and the flagstaff to monopolize the sky- line.

They were obliged to be content witb de- stroying the interior structures, the parapet, and dismountig the guits. These latter were massive pietes and numbered forty, pointing across the harbour and out to sea. It was in the sumîner of 1782, dur- ing what is known as the Hudson 's Bay Last War, that the Frenchi Ad- mirai de la Pérouse hove in siglit off Fort Prince of Wales and demanded its surrender. Hie had only three smail vessels in his fleet, ail of whidh had suffered damage in the ice. bis erew and soldiers had been reduced by many hardshîps tbroughout the long voyage; bis stock of provisions was alarmingly low.. Altogether the invaders were in no condition to pro- secute a long siege. Unfortunately the Englishmen were unaware of this.

Without a single shot being fireCi on either aide, Fort Prince of Wates waa surrendered to the enemy.

But, fail- ing to accomplish this, they were taken, and for several weeks were confined in irons. Two, at least, of the cuiprits were far from tamed by the rigorous punishment. When the Frenchi vessels were sighted off the harbour, these two saw, through a possible fali of the fortress, a chance of escape from military bondage, and a. passage out of the country. But well aware th at Fort IPrince of Wales was capable of resisting the attack of sueh a puny squadron as lay before it, the scoundrels dreaded the out-. corne if Hearne determîned to resist. So to treachery they resorted. From one of the four corner bas- tions of the fort, in which were arch- ed chambers,*used as store-houses and magazines, there led an underground passage, with an outiet among the rocks in the direction of Buttons Bay. The only use that was made of the passage was for the storage of liquor, andat the time, according to tradi- tion, there were iii it a considerable number of casks of rum. The traitors planned that when the fort should be attacked they would désert their leader, leave by the passage, and join the enemy. The latter they would in- form of this means of acceas to the heart of the defence. A commade was taken into their confidence, in the hope that he would join with them, but the plotters were disappointed. The least lie would promise was flot to betray their plans to the Governor; lie was content to remain a passive aecoxnplice in the base act of treacli- ery. The enemy had landed on the shore, four hundred strong, with cannon and mortars and, dividing into two detachments, p'ractically surrounded the fort. Then, supported by the0 lieutenants of the frigates Astree, En- gageante, and Sceptre, Admirai de la Pérouse approached the gate and cati.. cd on Governor Hearne to surrender, Up to within a few minutes of this time the English had been busy with preparations for defence. Then the sudden panic of fear, told of by hîs- torians, fell upon Ilearne. One of the soldiers- 'twas lie te whoma the traitors had entrusted the knewledge of their plans-had rushed up and inforxned bis commander of the treadhery in lis ranks. With frantic haste, fearful that the enemy miglit be even now within the fort, Governor Ilearne tore the ceverîng off the mess-ý table, and running eut upon the para. pet, wildly waved it above his head. Tez:l minutes later, the victorions de la Pérouse, net having fired a single shot, marched through the gates of Fort Prince of Wales, known te be the màost formidable strongheld in the. North. Had Hearne but parleyed for a few minutes and investigated. te what ex.- tent the pletters lad gained their end, alI miglit have been well. The two traitors were net yet half-way through the passage when the Gov- emner learned of their escape, and that way of entrjince could easily have been blocked. But the moral effeet had been sufficient. Several years later, on the shores of James Bay, there feli into the handa of the company an English-. man, one of a party of French.Caria- dian trappers from Quebec.

         "CANADA'S COAST-GUARDS PRIVATEERS BY CHARLES S. BLUE THE creaton of miniature navies on the lakes, which formed the subjeet of a previous article,e marked a picturesque and, indeed, unique development of colonial sea power. But Canleton's thirty fight- îmg ships ,and Haldimand 's Provin- cial marine did not, by any mecans, represent the sum of Canada 's naval aspirations and achievements. On the 0cean, as well as on the inland waters, she had her armed ships and war fleets flying the Kîng's flag or carry- ing the King's commission, equipped and manned by lier own people and under her owncontrol. Like the navies of the lakes, these coast armadas had their limitations. They consisted of ships of a mîscel- laneous rating, mostly improvised for war purposes; their officers had littie or no experience of naval service, and their, crews were untrained and un- disciplined. And yet,,with ail these shortcomings, in the stirring sea, dramas that had the North Atlantic for a theatre they played an import- ant and not inglorious part. In the days wherr Canada was the prize for whieh nations contended there dwelt along hel, ocean frontier a maritime spirit born of a natural love for the sea, fostered by surround- ing conditions, and developed by close association with the power that ruled' the waves. The British navy, repre- sented by the squadron on the North American station, the training-school of so many illustrions seamen whose names are linked with Canadian bis- tory, was the bulwark to which the people of the Acadian peninsula look- ed for protection. Lt was not only a present help in time of trouble, but an inspiration and an influex4ce which dominated their social and business hf e. Halifax was the centre of a naval activity that gave colour and life to the community, and that was as bene- ficial to trade as it was profitable to the King 's service. There the of- ficers and seamen of the royal squad. ron found a temporary home and congenial society; money was plenti- ful, and so, were recruits. The \"lords, of the sea\" were heroes, whose ad. venturous if e, free and easy mani- ners, and swaggering mien, inspired a pride and admiration that looked kindly on their faults and, weý are told, even aped their vices. Thus was developed a spirit whieh supplied the Britishi navy with some of its finest matcial-hardy marin- ers, who could splice, knot, reef rail, and work a slip with the best in the service. It cauglit boys watching the cruisers corne ini wÎth their prizes, sent them to, sea wliile still of scho\u003eI age, and made admirais of them; witness the careers, 'writ large in Bri- *T4 e wooden Wals of Canada,\"1 in, ne, Canadien Magazine for May, 1913.

But it was îîot only in the service of the royal navy that the mariie zeal and patriotismn of the Aêadiaîî people was fully manifested. 1\u003eow- erful though it was, the North Atlan- tic squadron was îîot always available for the defeîîce of the bays, harbours, and rivera of the peîinsula. Its field of operations exteîîded froin New- foundland to Bernmuda, anld there were times when only a few ships eould be spared 10 guard Hialifax and thec surrounding ports. Ilence arose the neeessity for a systein of local de- fence, to provide which vessels were hired and manned by the Provincial Gýovernrnent. At one tirne Nova Scotia had as mony as four armed ships in lier service. Like the craft that coin- posed the littie navies of the New Egland colonies, with which they co- operated before the Revolution, they were of the chas known as guarda- costas, and, to quote the words of one of the Governors, were \"varions in their employ. \" Sometimes they were ntilized for transport purposes; at other times they did the work of scouts. Occasionally they acted as convoys, and more often as auxiliaries of the ships, of the navy. But they also took a part i the fighting, and in skirmishes with hostile -Indians, French brigantines, and marauding privateers, and gave a good account of themselves. More real and effective, however, ivas the part played by tlie Nova Seotia privateers. lIn the fight with France, ini the Revolutïinary coîîflict in the Napoleonie struggle in the war of 1812-14, these vessels, titted out chietly by the iiierchants of Hlalifax, Yarnmouth, Liverpool and other ports, îîîaîîned by local erews, a.nd coniristý- sioned in the naine of the King to buriî. sinik, destroy, or capture the ships of tuie cîîemy, proved a factor of some importance and a source of tîo litie gain, as well as of iaucli titril- ling adventure to those who took part ini tlieir operations.

With British rule established at Annapolis, the question of naval de- fence beeame one of some importance. For protection, the new colony could always look to the littie navies of New EngIand, or, iu the last resort, Wo flic ses power of Britain, but with this guarantee the early administrators of Annapolis do not appear to have been altogether satisfled. Seated around the flrst couneil board were military officers and gallant sea-doge who had taken part in the attacha upon Port Royal, sud who realized the neeessity for strengtliening thc defences of the settiement. Prominent among them were Jean Panl Mascarene, a elear- eyed and lion-hearted Huguenot, who was to figure proininently later in the history of Nova Seotia; and Captain Southack, a sturdy New Englander who lad commanded one of the pro- vincial slips of 'Massaéhusetts.Ma. carene was the first Wo recognize the advantages of a system of local naval defence. as lie was the first to fit ont a privateer; and it was doubtiess on his advice that in 1720 Gyovernor Philippa urged the provision of \"a ship of war, and two sloops of about flfty tons, wbieh are neeessary, and which may be manned out of the gar- risons and serve as guard v,.sels, as well as tugs and transporta Wo the places whicl do not admit of the men- of-war. \" To this requet the Lords of Trade appear to have paid no attention, and it was left to, the little colony itef to take thc necessary measures for its protection. When tIe Indian war broke out in 1722, Philipps and lis associates armed and manned several vessels for transport purposes, sud lu addition fitted ont two, sloops, one of them., the Wiflliam Augustuts, com- manded by Captain Soutliack. These took part in the fighting that ensued and caused considerable havoe amonag thc Indians. At the close of hostili- ties one of the ships was retained in the Government service and stationed at Canso, and a few years later it was replaced by a vessel described by Philipps as \"of a less burthen and more fit for the service. \" He ex- plained to the Lords of Trade that the old guardship required twelve men, whule six would be sufficient Wo man thc new sloop, whieh, we are told, cost,£280, It is evident froin the letters of thc Goveruor that the primitive Dreadnought was rcgarded wîth some pride, but of lier services there is no record, and we, hear noth- ing more of Nova Scotia's cost sen- tinels until thc renewal of hostilities between France and Britain in 1744.

There 15 ne evidence that in the first capture of the citadel of Frenchi pow- er-the Dunkirk of America, as it was called-the slips of Nova Scotia played anly part, but the operations broulit into prominence two douglity warriors whiose subsequent careers were closely identified witli the ser- vice of the Province, and wlio are en- titled te rank among Canadian naval heroce. One was Captamn John Rous, commiander of the Shirley, and Com- modore Tyng's riglit-liand manl; the other was Sylvanus Cobb, a captain ini Gorham's regiment wlio, like Kip- ling 's Jolly, was \"a kind of a giddy harumafrodite -soldier anld sailor, tool\"' Both were hardy New Englanders and both had gained a reputation as darig privateersmen before tliey en- tered the service of Shirley of Mas- sachusetts. It was Rous wlio, at Louisbourg, destroyed the last hope of tlie beleaguered garrison by a strategical move, that led t» the cap- ture of the Frenchi frigate Vigilant, whidli was on lier way te the fort with supplies. Thougli the Vigilant car- ried sixt 'y-four guns, while the Shir- ley luad only twenty, the fearless New Englandeýr engaged the Frenchi fri- gate single-handed, kept up a run- Ding fight, and decoyed her towards the British squadroni under Warren, at whose bands lier fate was sealed. 6- As a reward £or this exploit Rous was sent te England with the news of the fail of Louisbourg and, on the recommendation of Warren, who de- scribed huun as \" a very brisk gallant man,\" was given a command in the royal havy. Returnjng to tlie Acad- ian coast, lie was appointed to ll.M.S. Albany, witli instructions to assist in the defence of the colony. Cobb, tired of soldiering, appeared at Annapolis in commiand of a sloop catll the York, and thercaifter these two gaI- lant seamen were associated in many a hazairdous enterprise on behlf of the P'rovince. Whien Cornwallis founded Hialifax in 1749, it was to themn that lie turu- ed for advice and assistance. Indecil, one of Lis first acta was te take Cobb and his sloop into the Provincial ser- vice. \"I fonnd one CobI, a settler, io is tlioroughly acquainted with every harbour and creek in the bay, \" lie wrote te the Iuke of Bedford, and fortliwith lie assigned to, the coin- mander of the York the task or keeý(p- ing open communication witli Minas, Then the Governor decided to send him te Chigneeto te deal with La Loutre and the Indians, who were causing trouble, but through preina- ture disclosure at Boston, the design was not prosecutcd. Meanwhile Rous was adding te lis reputation as a figliter in the Bay of Fundy. There lie encountered De Vargoýr, and, after a figlit lasting nearly five heurs, compelled the Freneimien to surrender. Later lie fell in with anether Frendch man-of- war, off Cape Sable, with a similar re- sult. Again, when Boisliebert show- cd a disposition to, dispute possession of the St. John River, Roua in the Albany and Cobb in the York were sent te dispose of bis pretentions. The one, cool and calculating, first forced lis adversary te strike his col- leurs, and then mnode terms for aban- donment of the post.

At t his pcriod there were only thrce sloops of war on the Nova Seotian station, wliile the French lad a slip of scvcnty guns, two of sevenity-four, and two frigates. Consequently Gov- ernor Cornwallis decidcd te strength- en the marine force of thc Province by thc acquisition of two ncew vessels. These were the UJtysses, commanded by Captain Jeremiali Rogers, and the New (Jasco, in charge of Captain John Taggart. In 1753 they took part in quelling disturbances at Lunenburg, and two years later tle Ulysses was employed with the Al- bayand tle York on ïý,onekton's cx- pedition to Beauséjour, wlicre Cap- tain Rotis, who emnanded thc force, drove the French froni their positions aind took possession ofthe fort.

In anatlyzing thec situation it is ne- eessery toý bear in mmid the two aspects of fthe quarrel whicl lias emi- broiled nearlY every Enropean na- tion. First, we mnusf rememuber the traditionel1 fend between Servin and Ausitria-Huingary. War bctween these f wo nations lins been inevif able since the annexat ion ly Austria-H1ungary of Bosnia and Herzegovina i 1908.

These fwo provinces are inhabited by raf-erin speaking ftie samef languiage aind or tlie sante race as the Servian-Croafian and S1ev subjecis of -Austria-Huin. gary' and tice people of 'Servia.

The thouglit that Austria- llingary was regaî-ded as a dying na- tion touched the pride of the inurder- cd A\\rchduke, thec heir te the throne. Ile bent ail bis energies to the build- ing up) of Auistro-Ilungarian forces by ses and land, aîîd to rnaking theý Duial Monanchy lnot only respected but feared. It is tolerably certain that liis fatal visit to Bosnia was not calevilated to inake for peace. TIhie tixne evîidently had anrived for pick- ing a quarrel with Servia. Reli- gion plays a large part ini the polities of the Near East. Althougli the Serb is as a rule of the Onthodox Churcli, inroads have been miade by the Ro- man Catholie Church among the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia. With Russia in the field it becomes a\u0026ih net only of Slav against Teuton, but also of the Orthodox Churcli against the Roman Catholic. These religions snd racial quarrels, while looming big in the war between Austria-Hun- gary on the one side and Servia and Russa on the other, do not enter into the widen struggle which the action of Germany lias go unjustifiably pre- clpitated. The second aspect of the war, with Germiany, France, Russia, and Eng- land as the principal figur~es in the drama, transcende ail considerations of race and religion. It were more natural for Great Britain, for in- sitance, to be in alliance wîth Ger- many than witli France or Russa. Rseiallyv and religiously Britain lias more in comnmon with Germany than with lier other alies. The strong pro-Geninan sentiment that existed in flritain befone the wan had its risc in titis coîmnunity of interest between the two peoles. But the dream of Bismnarck and the Kaiser-the dneam of a Germiai Empire, strong not only on land. but also on ses-lias con- flieted with British ideals. TIc lnst for mnastery, so powerful in man, la a dominant factor in the re- lations of nations one to the othe'. Gerinany saw in Great Britain the principal obstacle to the realizatiou of her plans. Tb,,c inicidence of Eure- peau alliances iiwreased G;ermniîy's fears and growing- antagonisin.

That the work will be regarded as the one te wbjeh ail students of Russia must appeal is a foregone conclusion.

         "CÂNÂDIÂN MÂGÂZINE ADVIERTISER The Factory that Times the World By night, fromn the River Charles, one gets an iimpressive picture of the Walthama Watch plant at Waltham, Massachusetts. In capacity it is s0 great that it manu- factures three thousand watchi miovements a day. In the delicacy and scientific exactness of its processes, it has been accorded first place the world over. This is the oldest watch.plant in Amer- ica-the largest in ail the world. From it ta every corner of the carth have gone the Waltham instruments of precision. Nearly twenty million men and women time their daily movements by the Waltham Watches manufacturcd here. Jewelers everywhere regulate their time- pieces by the Waltham Chronometers,which they unhesitatingly accept as standard. In officiai naval services and on the best appointed yachts and motor-boats the au- thority of the Walthazn Marine Chronom- citer is regarded as final. Motoriste in every land depend upon the Waitham Automobile Timnepieces to give themn the exact hour under ail conditions of wind, weather, and road. And so we speak the literai truth when we say: \"This is the Factory that times the World. \" From this Waltham factory each year go timepieces which outclass ail competitors in the tests at the famous Kew Observatory in England. These trials arc the most au- thoritative in the world. More Waitham Watches receive the Kew Class A certifi- cate (af accuracy\u003e than any other make of watch-a proof acceptcd by watch experts as conclusive of Walthamn's unrivailed re- sources This prestige of Waltham has been %j during more than hall a Century af scient and commercial conquest. Waltham revolutionized the world's watch maki It has been the originator of new methc the inventor ai new machinery, a dar and successfui pioncer. In Europe wat making was a household industry, subdivil into more than a hundred distinct branc and employing thousands of men, won and children in their homes. At Waith ail these processes were placed under 4 roof and automatic machines replaced hands of the workers. The most import resuit of this change was that the wa parts became intercuzngoahie. To watch purchaser this meant not only finest watch in the world, but the posai ity of quicker, casier and cheaper repait case his watch met with an accident. The nucleus of the Waltham Camp. was formed in 1849 at Roxbury, then suburb of Boston. In 1850 a emali fact, was built and the model ai the first wal completed. Seeking a more favorable vironment, free irom dust, the camnpa moved in 1854 ta its prescrnt locationi Waltham, 12 miles fromn Boston, and t site today remains uniequaied for the mý ufacture of delicate instruments. On, i anc side is the River Charles, on the otU an'open park, witb abundant fluage, st light, and flowers. The atmosphere pure and dustIess. In 1854 the company employed 90 ha, and its output was 5 movements a day. 1 day it mnanufactures 3000 movements a d cmpioys a \"smail armny\" of People, and total output is nearly 20,000,00 wal movements.",
