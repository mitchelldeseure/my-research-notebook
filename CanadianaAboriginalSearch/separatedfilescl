         "10 morality and existence were at stake, she is the biggest dip-lomatic dolt that ever occupied a place in the sun. Why blame or ostracize Liehnowsky t The brains of Berlin and the Father-land are to blame. The conduct of the war so far has been a battle royal be-tween the strategists. Most certainly there never was a galaxy of men of equal capacity and genius, with William, Nicholas, Kitchener, JofFre, and Albert and French engaged in any one former war. Nor were there ever before twenty million men afoot at once. Four hundred and even six hundred miles of battle front is unheard of in history. There is not a shadow of doubt that tlie Emperor is the genius of Germany, with at once a most comprehensive, active, a \\ exact mind. Von Hin- denburg in the fi»]d is famous, but he has enjoyed only a limit-ed scope. Thei strategic railroads have enabled the Germans to fly from pomt to point, from East to West, with almost light- mng rapidity. Whatever may be the finish, history will assign German strategy, mobility, and resource its fullest compliment of praise. On the other hand, the collective play and co-opera-tion of Nicholas and Joflfre is intended to wear down the nerve, the stamina, and the resistance of the giant in the fatal ring. Pour hundred miles in Prance of trenches have braziers and baths and music boxes — they are simple, modem cave- dwellers, with shooting irons to keep off the wild animais over the way. The Russians have been by far the most active, re-sourceful, and dogged, and their general, the Grand Duke, is easily the greatest genius uncovered by the war. He will probably be the first King of the reunited Poland. There is an implication in this that the Allies will win and there is lately some reason for it. The United States have been shipping arms and ammunition to whosoever will buy but as the Germanic Alliance are pretty completely blockaded tne British Allies are the only ones receiving them The bit-terness and resentment of Count Bemstorff at Washington show the way the wind is blowing; and he may shortly have his passport if he doesn't keep his temper. The Bethlehem steel boom means that Wall Street knows a secret. It would appear that Schwab has shipped enough artillery to place a big gun every ten feet of the four hundred miles. That seems fabulous, but, even heavily discounted, it would indicate that the Germans will have their match when the campaign opens in May. The battle of Neuve Chappelle is a case in p,iint So many great guns were concentrated on a limited area that whole ranks were buried under the churning earth. If rumours can be trusted, Nicholas and Joffre will take the offensive simiUtaneously, and will move on to victory— or defeat",

         "ThrPanalv Travel Talks (Rtvltwtd by A. O'M.) THE plan of this book penults the learned and romantic author to be possibly more entertaining than if he was held down to the rigidly logical and chronological sequence of an historical treatise; and certainly the title \"Travel-Talks\" puts one at ease, expecting as he does a series of chatty chapters about the incidents and experiences of his sojourn in the sunny South. To our amazement we meet the most grandiloquent descriptions standing studded every-where in these pages. It is true that at times he becomes colloquial and uses the language of the street; but far from pleasing it rather offends, and personally we should prefer him to keep pace with Prescott throughout than to drop, no matter how amusing, to words and phrases that need the apology of inverted commas. This is so infrequent and negligible, however, that we shall hardly be pardoned for adverting to it. The grandeur is so sustained that the more we read it the more we are amazed at the fluidity and felicity of his ornate phrases. The book has a clear and well arranged plan, Sonora and the Yaquis occupying the attention in the first part; Baija and Digger-Indians in the second part; and Arizona and the Papagoes in the third. He discusses in very orderly fashion the character of these various regions and in detail gives us a verbal photograph of the tribes that inhabit them. With a few striking and graphic phrases he gives us the joundaries of Sonora; shows that geologically it is part of Arizona; and adverts to its wonderful wealth which must under present unfavorable conditions remain unexploited and unexplored. He enters his own preserve when he undertakes the task of showing the origin of the Yaquis Indians; for he has been profoundly familiar with this topic for a quarter of a century; having in 1894 published his work on the Indians of North America. It may be doubted if there is an ethnologist living who can compare with the author in his familiarity with the topic of his choice. The brevity of the sketch, its broad out'-nes, its freedom from lumbering details make it decidedly s, ong. We see first the great Athabas^m Iribe of the North and the sedentary Yumis of the South.

If the Dinnes emulated the woU in ita ruthlesaness and rapacity they doubtlesa approximated him in physical and mental qualities and became in every country they infested the terror of their bewildered and dazed victims. It is a case of prophecy, by a psychological hypuotism secur-ing its own fulfilment. The fact that the Fathers of the early missions called 8on- ora \"infelix\" unhapg^r— a sufficiently sordid sobriquet is ample evidence that the wolf's ineffable ferocity was matched by t^ese terrible men, who, secreted in their mountain lairs, and knowing the safe ambushes and hidden passes, bounded forth in howling packs upon the lonely villagers and trains of travellers, killing the men and carrying off the women and children to the fastnesses of their forest dens. One can imagine how inaccessible the rock recesses are from the delightful description the Dean gives of the Sierras Madras Mountains, the Urique river and the Gran Barranca Canyon. They certainly do afford the Indian a deadly ambush and besides they have another office ; they delight with ecstasies the traveller, as viewing the panorama of wonders, he lingers and languishes in meditation on the greatness of nature's forces and the works of God. The writer also has furnished to him unexampled opportunity for his powers of portraying impressions received here from the splendors of Heaven's grandest handiwork. It was fortunate for us the Dean, as both traveller and writer, went this way as we doubt thf\\t there is penned anywhere a more picturesque photograph than IS found in his chapters on the Grand Canyon of Sonora. He gives us a glance at the imperishable peaks and spires of the Sierras, receiving and reflecting the rays of the eternal sun; and then with little regard for our nerves, lets us look mto depths immeasurable to man where the Urique river flowing in flood is an ungovernable torrent. With the magic of his imagination he translates us over tracts of time to the days when the confederate waters of the mighty river were only raw recruits in lonely isolation on the crests and slopes of the mountains, where by the instinct of aggregation they slowly gathered and zigzagging down searched their way to the sea. With dramatic skill, like the grave digger's scene in Ham-let, he takes us away from the towering peaks, perpendicular walls, frightful abysses, gloomy depths and precipitous can-yons where the wines of wonder opiate and dull the sense to the quaint tropical town Guaymas on the Gulf of California Here our nerves relax and we have the sensation of repose m the company of the gentle and refined Don Elonzo Epinosa Here, too, we first meet his majesty the burro and we are much",

He is called the clown and puppet of domestic beasts ; but he is rather an imperturbable philosopher; he is a stoic among fatalists. He is the staff of emergency, the anchor of hope. His serene equanimity is as cool as quicksilver in January and will not turn a hair though VesuviuB and Matterhom be in damnable conspiracy , against him. His nerves are of steel and his feet are as safe as the moun-tain goat's. He is the precursor of the pioneer and carries the packs of the explorers, prospectors, surveyors and settlers to the valleys and plateaus and untenanted wilds. He has done more for civilization than senators ar d savants. All hail the burro! After these moments of playful cynicism and satire the author grows philosophical and solemn ; the words of Solomon \"for in much learning is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow\" become his text. He has been observing the trend of sociological phenomena and comes to the conclusion, rightly we think that the peaceful, industrious, uneducated peoples of Mexico have a more equitable distri-bution of what we call happiness than the busy pleasure and science seekers of the most brilliant centres. Whom the gods would destroy, we used to say, they first made mad. Now it must be amended to say, they first educate. Germany's scientific numerical and intellectual superiority made her immoral and mad. Shall we say, with the Dean, that the peasants of West- ihalia, Normandy and Flanders have more happiness and vi.tue and sense than the ambitious, confident, restive Junkers and war-lords T After gazing with zealous eyes on the huts and haunts of these peaceful peoples, he lifts his eyes and sees the sunset in the west. His words are so very like the strain of Shelly 's ■Revolt of Islam\" that I make no comment but merely quote The air was preternaturally still and was filled with the reflected glory of the departing sun. The sky to the east was like a lake ot blood, and under it the ancient mountains were colored m deep purple and violet, '.'he sun was an enormoi.'i ball of fire floating in the heavens and above it were banKS of clouds through which flashes of bloody light came and at times huflg to their fringes.

Using the historic present the author treats us to one of the liveliest passages in the book: The call of the mountain allures him; the remorseless sun paces him; he staggers in the deKert as if the air were afire and his brain ablaze; his cycn are wild and shot with blood; his gait is shambling and he ages in a day; ho is mad and tries to shout; his sigl ', is gone; his limbs are numb and he falls upon the desert dead. Hypotheses are unhistorical but the author is as much at home with fiction as with fact; for again and again in this book he treats us to experiences, which the author could not personally have had. His imagination is so apt that he can clothe the bare bones of travellers' tales with all the warmth and realism of detail witnessed by one returned from the desert (if death or the madhouse. We doubt that the Dean is an expert psychologist yet he shafts and explores the mines of the mind with the artless ease of a Shakespeare. He makes Milton's \"Gloomy Ven-geance\" his apology as he portrays the phenomenon of the wandering voice. The untravcUed. the stolid and the in-expert may be amazed at Oallego's cx|ierience but those who have had to do and to deal with the religious, and the poetic mind know that in their solitudes and labyrinths there are heavens and hells quite concealed from the vulgar gaze. It would be idle and misplaced to analyze here the mental pro-cesses that produced the ringing of the bell. The writer con-cedes it all and believes it all instanter. The law of association of ideas and images will account for the senoritas crossing the plaza and the hearing of Mass. That the miner was con-scious it was an hallucination would not cure or cast out the obsession. For the lunatic, the lover and the poet arc of imagination all compact and live in a subjective world where they separate the currents of sanity and insanity, avow and deplore the \"wildness divine\" and yet have no thought if they could of casting it out. We are indebted to the Dean fbr his description of the \"wandering voice\" and the lonely ap-paritions mistlike and mis-shapen that assumed human form and whose illusions are so real that long after return to civilization they will not down ; for many will thence undertake to explain seientiflcally mental kinks and caprices formerly charged np to human per\\'ersity.

Peru, China and Japan; go to the boiled and blistered sands of the South to the froien fastnesses of the North ; go wheresoever mortals were howso forbidding the clime, the country or the tribe and there you find the black robed stranger. What if a Jogue had hi-: fingers hacked off; what if a Lalemont and Braboeuf were burned at the stake; what if a Barnum were frozen in the wilds of Alaska; what if a Law were eaten alive by rats in Africa t No matter, the depleted ranks were en-thusiastically filled at once. And to-day, after three hundred years they are as scholarly, as pious, as refined, as daring, as unselfish as in the days of St. Ignatius Lnyola. _ ,. What a phenomenon! How explain iti The Fie- :h infidel *elician Pascal tries to credit it to the spirit of diacipline, and devotion to their founder, and other natural causes, but Dean Harris as successfully meets and minces his arguments as New-man did Gibbon when he maintained the same, touching the miraculous spread of Christianity in the first three centuries, inia fTecthmkcr, he admits, is unusually calm and dispassion-ate, seeking as a sociologist the origin and growth of an un-doubted phenomcion. But in that there is the rub. There is more in the church than in society— there is the supernatural. There 8 where Gibbon fell down, where Parkman fell down where Pascal fell down, where all merely materialistic minds tall down. The Dean appeals triumphantly in his apologia to f\u003ct. 1 aul as th\" prototype of the Jesuits and quotes his eternal paradox, I take pleasure in my infirmities, in rciiroaches, in necessities, in persecution, in distresses, for Christ's sake \" Intoxicated with the wine of this supernatural paradox, the Jesuits Kino, Salvatierra, Copart.

Besides, there is here Cohino Forest, the Virgin river, the Mogollan moun-tain and the Tonto abyss; all of which nature made and fashioned when in an experimental mood. It was not the 'prentice hand of nature, however, that planted this mosaic pavement. There are hundreds of acres of it and the cubes are as methodically arranged as the cones of the giants' causeway in Ireland. Nor was it an inexpert in art who painted this forest with all the variety of tints and colors of a painter's palette. Solomon himself when he sought silver for his palaces would have come here to Planeha de la Plata for these 2,000-pound nuggets. Here in the Diabolo Canyon the heavens have complemented the eup of wonders. You may see here the greatest of meteors, with the channel It cut, careering through the earth six hundred feet deep and a mile long. To these cosmic and cataclysmic wonders add a world of vegetation, and the scenic wonders that Dante would have adored are complete. Hero we may view three thousand aowering plants, three hundred kinds of grasses, six hundred varieties of the cactus. This flora of the desert is the food and shelter and drink of its fauna. It is a ease of God temper-ing the wind to the shorn lamb, or fitting the back to the burden. A scientific curiosity and question is where the desert vegetation gets its moisture. Both the sand and the air are dry and yet the barrel cactus contains ten gallons of pure water. The deserts themselves are among the greatest won-ders of the region. They were onee lakes and the salt and soda found on them in abundance proves that Salton Sink and Great Salt Lake may some day be similar deserts, or vice versa that all these deserts may again be seas. Such pos-sible transformations as these make one shudder to think how short the time is man lives on earth compared to the vast spaces consumed in cosmic evolution. Revelation doesn't allow us te count time in the millions but scientists stagser and stop at nothing. The prehistoric mansions, \"Casas Grandes,\" are the won-der of antiquaries. They certainly postulate an educated people. Who were theyf Where did they come from! They had an aqueduct. Did they also irrigate the desert? No",

         "I Antony and Cleopatra THK fate of the fearleNs orator, the great general, the dnminant triumvir, is, of course, the main 'motif of this great tragedy. Others there arc— and great ones — that, in their power and perfection, will hardly sub-serve the ends they ,-.re ordained to ; but, towering and terrible though they be, thty must down before the fate and the for-tune of this 'demi- Atlas' of the world. When the great Julius, in his palmiest days came home to Ecuie, it was Antony, the immortal Marc Antony, the true and trusty Antony, that thrice offered on the Lupereal the 'golden round' to Cffisar, which he did thrice refuse. When the bleeding corps of the ambitious CKsar lay on the marble of the capitol, and the assassins, Cas- sius, Brutus, and the rest, like bloodsated lions, stalked pom-pously about, it was Marc Antony, who subtly gained the privilege to speak in Ceesar's funeral— and more subtly used It in that gem of peerless, passionate oratory, the like of which has never since fallen from the lips of man. When sovereignty shifted, seatless and uncertain, among the aspirants to power, Antony cemented the Triumvirate into being, and chose the East as his seat of empire. But then, oh then, when his imperial sun hung only half-high on the meridian line, it tumbled per-pendicularly down, toppled bruskly off its base, tipped over as if the pedestal was seated on some unsafe trestle or deadly quicksands into the inky sea of di.s\u003e;race and oblivion. The Attic-Egyptian queen was the honeyed arsenic that warped at once his judgment and his instinct out of plumb line; ex-tracted the cunning, gorgon-like, from his eye ; left him cupid- iike, maundering, sightless, shiftless, feeble and undone ; drag-ged him yawl-hke from the Cydnus to her Egyptian shores; and finally east him up like some dismantled hulk to rot at the high mercy of time and the elements. The mephitic, miras- mic air of Egypt has undone armies ere now— but Cleopatra single-handed, with her lethal fpell, held, hoop-bound, the greatest of the sons jf men. The greatest soldier is turned the greatest liar.\" \"Your love is false.\" \"Where are the sacred vials you should fill with tears for Fulvia's death?\" I see in Pulvia's death how mine shall be received.\" Antony feels the serpent's tooth and says, \"You'll heat my blood- no more.

How apt to catch another Antony.\" Cleopatra was only thirty-nine, had hardly climbed the heights of her meridian splendor, and it was well for young Augustus that she had nursed that \"baby-asp\" at her breast; that she had died in high Roman fashion to escape the cliastisemcnt of Octavius' sober eye and the Roman triumph else she might have sat ou the car as it rode home to Rome with Octavius' offering as much incense at hpr shrine as ever Antony did, or any other devotee did to this incomparable goddess of the Nile. Cleopatra assisted in some way Brutus and Cassius; and Antony, the Triumvir of the East, had summoned her to render an account of her conduct. They had met on the Cydnus, and there the dotage began. This lady of the Nile was young and Antony was old, and, at least, at this stage of her fancy was merely flattered by the attentions of the great Roman orator and general, and who will deny that greatness lends a glamor and an argument where otlier charms are absent. \"Hear the ambassadors'\" There s a good advice, but the general rejoins, \"Fie, wrangling queen, no messenger but thine and Demetrius is forced to say.\" I am full ■iorry that he approves the common liar that thus speaks of lum at Rome; but I will hope of better deeds to-morrow.\" He knows the general. Demetrius knew no hoops of steel would hold Antony when he heard the news from Rome. \"He'll do better deeds to-morrow,\" and so he did. The announcement that Fulvia forsaken and chafing with pique, had attacked Lucius, woke up the spirit f f the man and husband within him, and then how he mp' have raged and ranted, and strode up and down his feminine, fleshly alabaster cage when he heard that La- bienus banners fluttered over Asia, Syria, Lydia, and Ionia Ihen must Antony say ot Enobarbus; \"Speak me home mince not your words, rail at me in Fulvia 's phrase.\" Idiot that I am I deserve it. \"These strong Egyptian fetters I must break or lose myself in dotage.\" The Roman thought is now m possession, and no one is more aware of her weakness than Ueopatra, or his strength, when occasion called him home A new but unnecessary motive is added, when he hears \"at Sicven Fulvia is dead.\" For a moment he is himself again If he has faults, he certainly also has his misfortunes, and Ueopatra is the greatest of them all. \"There is a great spirit gone_we could wish her ours again.\" This tragedy is a revolution forti-nately, in hand. Lepidus is not the lion the rther two are. Enobarbus and himself are busy dashing oil on the waters and water on the flames when things",

         "31 the \"milk-minded holy\" Macbeth— She's brief— \"All hail hereafter\" — \"I feel the future in the instant.\" There is an imagination projecting itself into the future. That active artisan has constructed for her the whole framework of time and she's even now enjoying the regal pomp of queen- ship. \"My dearest love,\" from Macbeth; he forgets the tigress; he's talking to the woman — and one, too, that he loves because she is a woman and not because she is now un- sezing herself — \"Oh never shall his sun the morrow see\"; \"you look up clear\"; and \"leave the rest to me.\" She has a sort of comic confidence, complete control and assurance. Macbeth does not demur to her but he does to himself; he's every inch a man; he has honor, intellect and will; religious and moral qualities; but he's a general and suffers from the defects of his virtues — ^he's ambitious; he must fight it out — and the struggle is titanic— the victory is his own — \"We'll proceed no farther in this bloody business.\" \"Bring forth men children only.\" Macbeth has now broken away from his moral and manly anchorage ; he admires her undaunted metal and now the temper of the red line of battle is up in him— \"I'm sealed and I'll send each corporal agent to this terrible feat. ' ' , \"I '«'d their daggers ready; he couldn't miss 'em\"— Had he not resembled my father as he slept I had done it\" —a queer evidence of the woman. She's only fooling herself. I ould sentiment have a place among such unruly fiends in her mindt She is afraid of blood; when she's exasperated she actually does go and \"guild the faces of the grooms,\" but when she hears that the soldier has despatched them both —without a shudder she swoons— and that's the end. Her sex sits on its throne again. Macbeth found his daggers- but there was another dagger— one in his mind; he thinks It s m the air; it marshals him to his room; but that last argu-ment of love, the diamond from Duncan to his wife sets up a delirium and now he's a mad man. Was there ever such a struggle, and, that too, in the mind of a soldier. All tinctured with the Tyrian dyes of blood. Religion has a \"seat in that distracted globe\"; \"I could not say amen when they said God bless us ; \"why couldn't I say amen!\" \"it stuck in my throat ; \"I had most need of blessing.\" 'The woman is cool and he crazy. She sees the incongruity ot mixing religion up with murder. \"That way lies ruin\"- consider not so deeply\"; \"must not be thought after these ri.T;i, .*''«*?\"\u003c' ?\u003c\"•«\" keeps echoing in Macbeth's ears and then how sad and practical his reflection that \"Neptune's ocean won t wash his hands— but rather they will the multi-tudinous seas",

Macbeth is resolved to out-face fate and the witches, but in an instant Lennox announces the escape of Macduff. And then, oh cruelty, how thou dost \"curd and posset\" the milk of kindness in a murderer's breast; \"Give to the sword his wife, his babes and all that trace him in his line.\" How woefully, how pitifully does the abandoned lady bewail her fate and berate her heartless husband ! But hear his far cry from the camp: \"Oh hell kite! All! What all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop.\" This last, how desperate a deed and yet so wanton. Help-less, harmless babes and their abandoned mother, murdered! What docs not this monster deserve » Far off in Northumber-land Malcolm Macduff, Siward and their ten thousand are treading the confines; they need no \"Whetstone for their swords\"; \"their grief converted to anger blunts not their hearts but enrages them.\" The modern Medusa at home in Dunsinane wanders nightly in her sleep muttering \"Hell's murky\"; \"Fife's wife, where is she nowT\" \"All the perfume of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.\" \"His dearest chuck\" is demented.

Now he berates the equivocation of the fiend; sees the end \"they have tied me to the stake, I cannot ay.\" \"Roman fool dies on his sword; 5 « ,. t \"' '\"'\" hound, turn.\" there is the voice of Mac-duff; the unborn, the untimely ripper\"; \"ye juggling fiends, \"Birnam wood is here and one not born of woman.

         "I OtheUo PARING down improbabilities is a task arduously not easily attained. Yet Shakespeare with a wizard wand seems to accomplish the impossible. The grotesque is probable, the probable is possible, the possible is actual, the actual is easy, the easy is amiable — and then we're asleep — it is an illusion, a dream, and wo go like Dante wherever our Virgil leads us. The Greek chorus charmed the Trilogy into imaginary unities: Unities of action, of time and of place, but the genius of Shakespeare dispenses with all but action ; gives us all sorts of absurdity but so long as he throws in his alchemy, we mjitsiur no doubt, disinterest or dissent. The scene of Othello is cast in Venice and Cyprus, in an age when the Indies East and West had just opened their \"antres vast and deserts wild,\" to the amazed imagination of Europe. The wildest dreams and dramas are credible. Shakespeare takes the \"tide at the flood and leads the people on to fortune.\" Venice owns the commerce of the world and \"what she has she'll hold.\" The improbable element, \"a Barbary horse,\" a \"black Moor\" or a \"thick-lipped negro,\" even with the great-est fame, fortune, prestige, wooing and winning an aristocratic, artistic Venetian blonde, only gives opportunity to the poet to throw over it \"All the perfumes of Arabia\" and seduce us into adolescent admiration. Othello in 'ie service of Venice is easy enough to understand: some of the greatest generals of Borne were barbarians, but his romance is of a different sort. The union of the blonde and the black is not only los- sible, but here it is inevitable. Shakespeare throws about the Moor such a mantle of majesty that we wonder not at this pure, passionless, plastic creature being spelled into ecstasy by the mere recital of \"the disastrous chances, and his hair-breadth escapes, his moving accidents by flood and field.\" This IS not the only place our poet tames caprice. The pound of flesh IS as absurd as that other of handing out one's heart as a pawn. But we do not mind it much ; it in no way mars our admiration of the \"Merchant of Venice.\" Again Lear very amiably abandons his kingdom although kingship he could not and did not. Yet this keystone once placed in the arch we never think of it again, but just enjoy our obsession to the end of its most bitter and abominable consequences This play has combined the excellencies of Hamlet and",

         "iLllTleZ on the point in which a climax or character excels all others and then paint it as it is. lago the candid, cordial, consum-mate villain needs prismatic coloring and care to sustain his intrigue and yet award him in the end dramatic justice. Compared with him it was comparatively easy to hew out the outlines of the statne-like Othello. One might as easily compare Lacoon and Pompey: So complex and so simple are these conceptions. Othello is simple, upright, righteous. A good man, honest soldier, great general. The natural cunning, the infinite craft of the \"ancient\" turned to vinegar and gall of hypocrisy, by the election of Cassio could not have had an easier victim than the noble Moor. How contrary and how complementary these characters are, can only be realized when one sees how successfully he wins and warps the whole fabric of his mind. An Essene withdrawn to the wilderness of Arabia communing with the birds and the beasts: and the trees of the forests; riveting his hea.t on the God of Abraham and singlely serving him could know as much of the world and Its wiles and wickedness as Othello does. Born and brought up in the camp he had learned the art and exercise of arms, tactics, strategy; and the conduct of campaigns are the con-stant food of his mind. Daring, adventurous and ha dy he breasted every difficulty and broke every obstacle ; he became the prop and pillar of the state and even arrested for a hein-ous crime he still retains the confidence of the council and is appomted commander of the army and fleet setting sail for Cyprus. Magnanimity is modesty, pride is poverty. Othello had balance, perspective and proportion. He knew what he knew, and he knew his limitations. He distrusted his judg-ment in matter alien to his own art, and here was \"the heel\" that the villain aimed at. His want of confidence in all else than war was his undoing. This is such a paradox that the poet paints it m his deepest dyes. It is quite the exception- odd and extraordinary to find a man who can and does proper-ly appraise his own merits. The world is wont to know all things, or at least they pretend they do. They will interfere dictate and dogmatize in matters and spheres entirely alien to their occupation, and very often foist an imposter and a fake into positions for which they are utterly unfit. The exact knowledge of our powers and accomplishments, and the can-dor and conscience capable of acting within these limits is so unique that the poet consecrates a complete plot to presentine the ideal. The question is canvassed— whether Shakespearl has not over idealized the character of Othello in making his honesty so unsuspecting that by completely underrating his own capacity and neglecting ordinary caution and",

         "AA Antipodal lu they may seem, Othello and lago are the very tongue and the groove to each other. The very nobility of the one is the medium in which the other moves. A very ocean of candor and callous criminality sweeps over the splen-did personality of Othello and he is actually sinking before he is aware of the heavy sea of cynicism that has been surging all around him. The scoundrel is a surgeon, he has anatomized the carcass, and knows how to articulate the every joint, nerve and artery of his victim. The soldier is simple and unsullied ; he knows only one woman ; he has never generalized, but the news that all women, especially Venetians, are frail, finds ready reception. Appetite, at best, is caprice; love is lust, and women, for whatever reason, have been branded •'the weaker sex.\" This is philosophy to Othello. Had he been abroad daily in the streets of Venice, how little he would have listened to these scraps of worldly wisdom, but the ancient camp was as clean as the porch or the grove, and this -mwilling saint vouchsafes to protect his witless, wilelesg lord by his own experienece and wisdom. What a pity the power of lago wasn't turned into another channel. His honesty, his bluntness, his candor are attributes of his. He abuses them, of course, but, if circumstances were other and opposite, one ventures to aver that, like Paul and AugiT;tine, he would have been mightier in good than in evil. There is, however, everywhere he appears absolute, unadulterated evil, but that 18 his business. Like Bichard and Edmund, he has been wronged. Notwithstanding his ability, experience and know-ledge, influence robbed him of his lieutenancy, and he must needs aven,;e the evil. How contemptible his tone; in every-thing he says to Cassio of Desdemona, and even as compared with the pawn, Boderigo, he shines like anthracite with black-ness. The poor \"snipe\" that worries the life of Brabantio, turning his house into a bam — \"This is no grange\"— was an early suitor for the hand of Desdemona and brought jewels over the sea to win her even when she was another's wife. Yet this manly, magnificent miscreant always speaks with re spect of the woman he loves and follows. How naturally the poet lets or makes his characters move in their respective grooves: Othello, simplicity; Boderigo, pertinacity; lago du-plicity. We blush if we miss the point of humor, but we stare vacantly if we miss the moral in a play. Many there are com-pletely unconscious of the pith of Shakespeare's highest Idealizations. Beware of the smooth water, it may run deep • beware of the mountain, the base may crumble ; beware of the waters, they may be poisoned. The poet would stultify him-",

The saintly youth who never thought of the lUce, incessantly excited himself to fervor and constantly said to himself: \"Bernard, Bernard what hast thou come here to doT\" When he commenced to taste the sweetness of divine love, he feared so much to lose these interior consolations that he scarcely permitted his senses the privilege of communing with the sights and sounds and society about him. He soon contracted the habit, which became a second nature, of thinking so continually of God that he saw without seeing, heard without hearing, and ate without enjoying the bread of life. H,. had become so dead to himself that he seemed neither conscious or curious of any-thing about Him. In all his exercises, his fervor was admir- ^e, but especially in the porformauce of his ordinary affairs WhUe the others busied themselves where skill was required he used fte spade and axe, and often carried great loads on his Moulders. During the seeding and harvest, ordered by the Superior, as being weak and inexpert, to sit down and rest, he was extremely afflicted, and prayed God fervently to grant him the strength to participate in the work like the otners. External affairs interfered in no way with his prayers his umon and converse with God. While working, he secretly prayed or meditated on the Scriptures. He often said it was in the fields and foresta that he got his highest spiritual in- ^irations. Durmg the conges he was quietly at reBection.

The report elaborate, classical and complete, of the pro-ceedings of the Council of Sens sent by St. Bernard to Inno- ?!S\\^ urefragable proof that the latter earned the title *ather of the Church,\" but it is more it is a manifest of the mental stature, equipment and compass of the man they were refuting. It stands indeed still an imperishable monument to the memory of both. Abelard was as subtle as rapid and as keen as St. Augustine. And, too, his early career in many regards was almost an exact parallel to that of the greatest uninspired mmd the church has produced. Yet polarity set their characters a worid asunder. The Bishop of Hippo was senous, profound and pious; Abelard was acute and learned but supercilious, vain and selfish till the bolts of age and the church struck him down in the very arena where the wild plaudits of the world, like the Siren, had deceived his",
         "heart Character THERE IS uothiiij; more inijiiirtaiif, it must ii|i|)ear, than the study of character; tor knowledge of it as the clement of our personality imd that of society is the key botli to success and I'ortune. Nor may we ap-proach It lightly. On the contrary it is the most difficult and protound subject one can \\iell undertake to explain Psychol-ogy IS the science of the soul and the soul is spiritual and tmmaterial. There at once is tlic elusive, subtle element Th- matenal i,s tangible and may be weighed and measured. Tha. task is comparatively easy. Character which is the damp of the soul easdy escapes our awkward efforts and reonrcs the keenest concentration to comjirehend and categorize the elements that so impress our spiritual natures as to make them what they are. The seal that leaves its image on the meted wax is tantamount to these influences, and as the seal may be artistic or crude so may be character. The com-mon sense of the ra,re has alivays |ilaced the highest price on the nioral as)\u003eect (.f character and consecpiently calls it good or bad; treating all other defluitions, even if desirable as not paramount. This is, we think on the whole, highly creaitable to the race, but other elements, it must be admitted are not negligible. The will is only one faculty of the soul and as all the other faculties, emotions and jiassions are equally amenable to discipline, terms implving this, like tem-perate, artistic and intellectual, can correctly i.e added to good and bad. Indeed then character has so many phases ; if it is so com-plex and subtle one would imegine it would be the life study not only ot professors of psychology in colleges but of every one who sought success in the world. Perhaps nothing is farther from the fact, men are the victims of vices that are daily wrecking their lives and are quite unable to trace their ruin to Its particular source; nay, they are the happy posses-sors of virtue that has made them the day-stars of their age— the cynosures of all eyes and are blankly ignorant of the causes that produce those effects, \"Know thyself\" is an old adage and It would be as easy as it is old if men formed the habit early in life of notmg their mental, moral, artistic and physical equipment, of toning up this defect and pruning down that excess m whatever department of our being it appears.

If auch M the influence of the righteoui, sterling character on the world, on aociety, on hiatory, it will be interenting and profitable to trace the ideaa that dominated the variou- natioua of antiquity. The East had Pantheiam long before Greece had Stoieian or Christianity had Chastity, Poverty and Obedience. It ia atill charactenstie of Asiatics to live in pain and poverty and disease with a resignation and a heroism only comparable to that of the Mystics of the Middle Ages. That this is not religious, not rear- ed on the suoematural, on the hopes hereafter of a reward u amaiing and incomnrehensible, but it is nevertheless true, it ia ethical, it IS moral even, if not expressed in so many words. The Israelites though in the East were not Mongolian, and were not mfluenced by their stolidity or their Pantheism. They were sui gencrU, a law unto themselves. Prim the dawn of history they had a revelation and were tau it to be an ex-clusive people, and although litenlly can about by the neighboring nations they never lost their re.^ion, their morals or their character. It is true there are no philosophical ri'i- gories m the history of their speculation, indicating an ' '. science of ethics but from the fact that their government fo . long was theocratic, we may conclude that their morals «nd religion were always as fully fused, as they were originally in the Commands of Moses. The nearest approach to analysis of the virtues that con-stitute character is found in Isaias where wisdom under-standing and knowledge are set down as the qualities .,f the intellect while fortitude, fear and benevolence are tiie attri- butes of the will. If he has no words to express the control of concupiwence, a word which comprehensively expressed the Commandments sufficiently covered that vice The Greeks as usual, having a fine psychology in the intellect, the wUl' tie irasible and concupiscible appetite found words to ex-press the controlling virtues so crisp, so exact, sd satisfactory that even yet, after two thousand years, no thinker is so hardy as to suggest a change. Temperance was the antidote Of concupiscence, a word which comprehensively expressed the desires of the individual in the interest of self and society On the other hand fortitude presided over man's possessions",

If Von Moltke had (ot bia IT-inch guna playing un Liem, inatead of two weeka it would have taken two daya to demolidi It. What happened at Namur and Antwerp f A few daya laid both of them low.

Having your argument all ready and not uaing it ia a fool trick. That's what Von Moltke did and history will record his incompetence or mistake in the piping timea of peace when war has ceased its din. Now, aa the war, if virtually, is not actually won, it wUl be well and wise for us to steal into the armories and araenala of Essen J into the shops and the universities and see what were and are the arguments they have prepared. Arguments or rather argument— they had only one— preparedness (thanks for that word, Uncle Sam). But many elements enter this argument. Guns and gases there wore, but there were also men. And that is important. Their genins, their thrift, their industry, their frugality, their obedi- ence made them an ideal complement of the arsenals. The political vision, the statesmanship of Bismarck fo- ar ,' or for ill, brought this about. Professor and peasant *ere spokes in the great wheel of the State and if they discovered an Idea of social or scientific value they were in some way co-ordinated with the advisory board of the State. This complete organization of roial, educational, mechanical and po itical assets for peace and especially for war they call kultur; and certainly if you like Machiavelli. Frederick and Bismarck, you can find their quintessence in this method in the Prussian State. Nor were the arsenals and the universities alone: the laniily played a magnificent and fundamental part. Legions made and maintained the Roman empire, the Macedonian empire, the Asiatic empires and the Pagan savants of Berlin whatever their pretensions, knew well in the will-to-power doctrine numbers counted. Besides, they aimed at making every man a superman both in body and mind. The Kaiser set the example; he had a large famiW and for whatever reason, religious, moral or martial, the population of Germany mcrcased by leaps and bounds. On the contrary, Italv and France were decadent. They were addicted to cclebacy singleness and suicide and soon fell behind.",

         "were 1!^: superior men. T: is eminence ramified as far as the mechanical and industrial arts. Mr. Wells, a distinguished and loyal Eng-lishman, recently wrote that, ever since the opening of hostili-ties, the German novelties in war had kept the allies guessing and improvising and even at the moment of writing they had succeeded only indifferently well in matching them. In the avenues of the air really the only way to beat Mr. Bloch's deadlock they are easily superior, if not supreme. Prince Zeppelin's machine has no competitor. So far as expense in men and money it has not done much damage but nevertheless it is a wonder and may, after the war, for peaceful purposes revolutionize passenger traffic and commerce. It might be mentioned, too, that in dyestuffs and chemicals generally we depend entirely on Germany for our supply, the secret not being known elsewhere. And besides there is her diplomacy. We discounted her diplomacy too drastically elsewhere and must reverse our views. They are not such dolts as we dubbed them. We have discovered recently that they own practically all of the Bal-kan and Scandinavian thrones ; for by owning the queen thev own the king, the court, aye, also, and the army. Popular sympathy is a broken reed as compared with a queen. Take Greece for an instance. Cleopatra asked Antony \"What about the married woman!\" She always counts— with her husband. Shakespeare knew human and social facts fairly well. The diplomatists and others ought to read that bard not for poetry but politics. To return : the armies and the courts of Europe are honeycombed with Teutonic princes, princesses and nothing but an equinoctial monsoon will drive them out. They have hyphenated every court and camp and democracy on the continent and hitched it to the ear of the Vaterland. They have beaten SavanofE, Delecasse and Grey at their own game. These play with paper, deed and document; those with kings and queens. And they count, as Scandinavia and the Balkans only too plainly prove to us. Knowing the possible points in our opponent's argument is only half the battle. We must also know the weak spots, the loose Joints in his armor if he has any. But really so far as we can observe, after years of attention and success in mobilizing men, money, munitions, psychology, scieucc, inven-tion and what not, they seem to have forgotten hardly any- thmg. All this brought about the weakness of its strength : they underestimated, underrated and even despised their neighbors — Russia, France and England. Nor was this mental attitude lost on the latter. People quickly diagnose hauteur, disregard and contempt. And outcasts— birds of poor feather flock together for consolation, companionship end even",

Japan is playing a selfish game of aggrandise-ment, [she IS a source of annoyance, if not weakness, in many ways to her Western allii-s at this moment. These debaters have now been on the stage a year and a half, and are still arguing. From time to time a new com-batant comes on, but the crowd is now so numerous and the platform so spacious that he is hardly noticed and he doesn't cut the figure he dreamed he would. Thus Italy, thus Bul-garia. But when will the contest be over; when will they become exhausted and who will give the decision t And will It be tamely accepted by the dialecticians when it does comcf Iheres the rub— exhaustion. Has every other possibility of peace passed by the board? That is hard to say, for the unexpected often happens, but let us see. The first phase of the war was mobility. The entrenchment after the Mame ended that, and Mr. Bloch came along and was justified, for every line now, short of an earthquake of high explosives, is practically impregnable. So the Western, so the Eastern so the Austrian Armies against machine guns are only lambs to the slaughter, and no general will pay such a bootless price. Ihere are spies and snipers by the thousand on both sides, so that soldiers must duck and stay ducked or die I be present phase is immobility; the old ideas of envelopine movements, Sedans and so forth, having been dolefully aban-doned f\u003eontal and flanking attacks! Nonsense! A volcano ot high explosives alone will drive either out. The navies too, are immobilized, the Germans having their trench in Kiel canal and the English in the ocean, where thev're proud to be The blockade is supposed to be starving Germany That's another dream. With the acreage of Belgium, France, Poland and the Balkans in their hands and Scandinavia and Switzer-land to draw from not to mention United States and Latin America it would seem that they will not be crushed that way As long as the Germans have Spandaus of gold they'll get lood. Another factor: this year twice as much food was pro-duced, root and cereal, as last year in Teutonic territory, for millions of men sowed and reaped under the goad of the bayonet. The Germans won't starve. Believe me, attrition exhaustion, paralysis on both sides is the only way out.",

It would seem that the Teutonic strain predominates, for he is a terribly titanic fel-low as the rapidity and ubiquity of his movements, sick and well, during this war most amply prove. That he possesses peraonal and family virtues, too, is evident from his numeroua and admirable offspring. There is no doubt of bis ability and culture. His early environments and opportunities were such as to bring out his talents and no doubt he was initiated into fie arcana of statescraft almost in the nursery. He appears to be a very Hamlet of intellectual activity without many of his moral misgivings. And like the latter, it would seem that he hardly needs to put an \"antic disposition on\" so near is his mental fibre to the lunacy of genius. He is a theologian and a preach-er; knows philosophy and the Bible. Luther and Kant are his spiritual progenitors. He is a soldier and a master of tactics and strategy. He is an artist, a connoisseur, an econom-ist, a statesman, a scientist and above all, he is a man of action. The elements are so mixed in him that he conceives and con-summates with the rapidity of lightning. The presto-change process by which, throughout the war, he has elevated and undone both office and honor proves him to be as great on the field as in the study. Shakespeare went wild over Henry V. and Richard III.; they were men of action. That seems to be a law. Desdemona fell in love with a Mauritanian Moor for the mere recital of his \"accidents by flood and field.\" Accpiding to that standard all men ought to admire the Kaiser and doubtle.is they do academically and in an abstract way. The doctrine of the divine right of kings is dear to him and is the main factor of his fanaticism. This doctrine has been rudely handled by an indignant democracy, and it was thought when Prance flung it overboard and England, in its own sly way was limiting the monarchy, this fond fabric of superstition or history was being stored in the limbo of lost causes. But no. The Israelites grew tired of Judges and wanted a king, because their neighbors had them. China must have, it would appear, a king. Japan has a Mikado but over there a dynasty is lucky if it lasts a hundred years. Then, also, we have kings at home but they don't pretend to be divine. Some of the English and French kings proved to be very human, or at least their necks did. We have no patience with the contention that this doc-trine is the cause of a real fanaticism or madness in him. He has too much method in everything to be a real lunatic. We shame ourselves in saying such. He is a genius, an en-",
         "122 thnmait, but no madman. He is the quinteitence, the white- Mp on the blue ocean of his countrymen. He is a part and parcel of the Teuton family and he's a credit to them aa their best specimen. He is industrious, aggressive, persistent and methodical and so are they. Some men are physical dynamos, and they must just be up and doing beeaoae of nerves and muscle and brain. The present Kaiser is evidently one of that type. Given fifty years' feverish, fierce activity and his storage is perfectly volcanic and infernal. Nor is he true to that metaphor, for a volcano will often smoulder lor a century before it explodes. The Kaiser, on the contrary has caught the imagination of his people by his pyrotechnics from the moment he put his foot on the throne. The titanic Crown Prince is a chip off the old block; he had to be rusti-cated again and again for out-Heroding Herod, being just a bit hotter than his father and that would not do. If memory did Its duty the latter should not have been offended, for the mild-manncred William, just one degree removed, tradition says, had similiar trouble with just such a boy. At any rate the Kaiser is a bom leader and \"hoch der Kaiser in the mouths of seventy-five million Germans with tears of admiration and joy in their eyes, is a proof positive that he is high and mighty\" and sets the pace for a pro-gressive people. The people always loved and followed a »au], a David, a Solomon— the Kaiser is a diluted decoction of them al . Prestige and power have always won the hearts of the multitudes. The light and heat of the morning sun make even the moles look up. As he rises on the ladder of the dawn, rushes across the meridian sky and dashes reck-lessly down to the sea, he draws the multitudinous waters to his gaze. Tis thus with every leader. The Kaiser will buy a bog and turn it into a garden ; he will drain it, he wiP till It, and they, his people, will do likewise. That's whv they love him. He's a German in all his wiles and ways. He will have a field day and crown the athletes, or a sham battle and depose a general— really depose him so he'll never rise again. Reviews are no joke in the Kaiser's kingdom. He wili go to the laboratory and generate gases; he will go tn th» opera and encourage art ; he will go to the church and preach better than the preacher. In the field he will address his army and draw down the blessing nf God, not once, but again and again. That is a leadership not lost on the soldiers- Protestants and Catholics alike love that little touch of re-ligion. Be he preacher or priest the Kaiser will walk arm and arm with him like a brother. Now then, how shall we reconcile all these activities; all the pretensions; all these pieties with the conduct of this war",

He threw the things of the child away, diamissing also both tutelage and paternalism at the same time. He actually began abandoning \"Roosevelt Politics\" !? J)'«/«\"P'\u003e'\u003e the dictator was displeased. It is rumored that Mr. Taft, after his election, in acknowledging his indebtedness to Mr. Roosevelt, was guilty of the indiscretion of saying that after brother Charles (a millionaire) he owed most to the ex-president, forgetting that money is nothing compared with political baptism and sponsors. The Armageddon was on between the pair of former friends at once. Mrs. Taft, it is said, made a break that wounded mortally the incipient dictator. When the convention came along Taft bought a steam-roller and the Republican machine hauled it all the way to Chicago, but rollers are useless unless they have something to roll on and T. R. would not lie down —stood up, in fact straight up, and bellowed like the bull moose that he is. He opened another convention and got him-self nominated. The electorate gave Mr. Taft four states, Mr. Roosevelt ten and Wilson thirty or forty. In a word Mr Roosevelt was the dictator; he took the stand that if Taft wouldn't let him in the aforesaid Taft would have to go out And he went. Another election is now pending and an American car-toonist has taken off the situation most masterfully. The train is hurrying on to the convention. On the rear platform all the \"favorite sons,\" Root, Hughes and others are grouped looking their likeliest. The G.O.P. elephant has his head stuck out of a window proud of his proteges. Underneath the train getting a bad boy's free ride, seated on the gear of the axle is Mr. Roo.sevelt with a typically Rooseveltian smile. The artist has read aright the signs of the times Roosevelt is not on the train or on deck; he is in his state room. But when he comes back from liis six-weeks' trip to Bermuda— a sort of a political big game river-hunting trip in South Africa and South Araerioa. he will leave his state room and not only go on deck, he will n.,, right up on the bridge and ring the bell for the engineer to do so and so and if he does not obey.

The mergetic K. of K. crossed the Channel and consulted with the *Yench ( abinet and chief of staff, and rumor has it that the aforesaid French general got as much and even more than waa commg to him. History, we hope, will draw over the incident, the veil of silence. We shall never know until history opens the archives and vaults of the great war, how Kitchener made out his case, but we may indulge the imagination that he stated some direct things directly. Again and again he went to Paris until the Cabinet was reorganized, and the best blood \u003end brains of France was put at the helm. Since that everything has been wholehearted, candid and generous. Common calamity makes real comrades. Oeneral Joffre a month ago took a turn at visiting and turned upm London. The English people were fascinated with the Frenchman, who, after the sea and their navy, waa a bulwark of their defence. They enthusiastically feted and dined and wined him. They acclaimed him like mad cataracts, but the General was too old to lose his head and he stuck right to business for his business was important. The French Cabinet and the French Oeneral knew things and apparently had the means of knowing them that Kitchener and the Cabinet did not know regarding the Gallipoli campaign and the Ser-bian expedition. We can easily understand all that now. General Hamilton s report, lengthy detailed and indignant, throws all the blame on the Government for not sending him a hundred thousand more men— more munitions— more medi-caments, etc. There is no doubt of the candor, honesty and conviction of this great general. There was just one thing wrong: he saw only a part of the chess board, only a salient a sector of the great war and above all he saw onlv through his own glasses and such glasses become narrow and only let m the quality and quantity of light the wearer wants. Joffre 's visit convmced Kitchener and the Cabinet that a Mediterran-ean cruise would be good for K. of K.'s health, as it frequently IS for Grey s. It might also be profitable to the allies' cause in the near East. And they would be as pleased to receive Magi as they once were to send them to the West. Kitchener took »",

The boys were anxious to get him out of the trenches as there was great danger, and a General's life is worth a thousand privates. But Sir Sam is fearless and always was. He returned to Canada in September and resumed his work in the Cabinet of his Country. In civil life Sir Sam was an editor and lived in Lindsay, Ont. Twenty or thirty years ago he was elected there to a seat m the Federal Government at Ottawa and has sat con- tmuously in it ever since. He became an efficient and even a redoubtable debater, and gained Cabinet rank on his merits. He 18 an Orangeman but he has never allowed it to bias his relations with his Catholic constituents or Catho'ic friends whom he counts by the hundreds at Ottawa and elsewhere. Dr. James L. Hughes for thirty years, chief inspector of Tor-onto Public Schools, is a brother. He was bom in the town-ship of Cartwright, near Bowmanville and received his early education from his father who was a school teacher. Sir Sam is sixty years young and is as active as a man twenty years younger. Recently he went on a tour through his own riding, although one could not imagine any political necessity, with his present prestige, and delivered a score of speeches in a few days. Time deals softly with the General, and when the war IS over, he promises to visit the museums of Berlin and bring home to Lindsay mementoes for each one of his constituents who deserves one. President Wilson, as the leader of the neutral nations, has occupied a prominent, nay, a paramount position in world controversy throughout the war owing to the vast wealth of his iiuimtry in natural resources available for military pur-poses; and especially for the munitions that his country was capable of turning out. Woodrow Wilson is a Southerner and was a university president when Colonel Harvey picked him out as possible timber for the Presidency. He soon became Governor of New Jersey and althoirgb no politician, by a queer streak of politi-cal luck as presidential candidate, he swept the United States, gaining as great, or even a greater majority than any man who was ever elected to the chair. Wm. J. Bryan in the middle of the Baltimore convention, when he saw his own nomination was impossible flung his whole influence towards Wilson and swamped Champ Clark who was picked as a winner from the beginning. But prophets are not respected by their own countrymen; and Bryan and Clark are both Westerners: so Wilson owes his nomination to Bryan and to 0 'Gorman and",
         "IM Murphy of New York who had, it is taid, i hand iu it. Be that a\u003e It may Wilson was soon flnnly seated in the saddle and as was proper and natural he chose Bryan an Secretary of State ; but the cart was before the horse all the time, and at last he kicked over the traces, aye, even out of the traces. Bryan is an enthusiastic pacificist, quite a th«ologian, preacher, lecturer, orator and journalist. There is no doubt of his righteousness, energy and integrity. But it would seem that successful politicians are never pious and depend-able. To be brief Damon went off and left I^thias weeping— we all imagine crocodile tears. Certainly if Lansinfj wept it was with tears of joy, for he very promptly got his job. It was the irony of fate that the peaceful McKinley and the proper Wilson both had war on their hands and the belli-cose Rnsevelt had to live on and on pathetically civil, during piping Uays of peace. At any rate I shall pass briefly in review Wilson's relations with the belligerents and the neutral na-tions during this great war; and we shall quickly see that he has had his troubles; but we shall also have to remember, that he had the Mexican war and a marriage on his hand*— particularly the latter, which would not lessen his worries. His first act, or the absence of act, was his peccatum irremissible. The alert Boosevelt, the lynx-eyed politician— Oh; pardon, statesman— at once nailed that mistake and grasped his opportunity; for he wants and will get a third term or know why. He has kept iterating and reiterating at opportune intervals ever since what ought to have been done. I refer to the scrap if paper incident or rather the violation of the neutrality of Belgium. Why was it a \"faux pas\" of Wilson not to have protested t Well, th neutrals were and are in the same boat. That the United States is large, populous and powerful doesn't affect the brotherhood of the thing; if she were small and weak and her geographical position was that of Serbia, Montenegro or Belgium she would know, and he would know, or ought to know, exactly what would have happened. There was a treaty, a convention, a pact, and England, France and Germany were the signatories solemn and adjured. That it was a case of life and death didn't make it moral, right or legal for Germany to break her oath— cast all honor under foot; nor did it pardon Wilson for not standing up for the rights of neutrals — on land— as he pretended to do at sea. The chimoring about the Lusitania because a hundred Ameri-cans went down is edifying and natural but narrow. The Americans were in principle merely neutrals and that is what the Belgiums were. Because the victims were blood of his blood, and bone of his bone, he follows the case mordently:",
         "13S 1? and because the Belgian! were not American neotrala, they may go to the dog», or Huna, or even elaewhere. This mistake and the shadow of it has been following him for a year and a half threatening at this moment to cheat him of another term. Roosevelt keeps rasping away at it and the American people have become convinced that if he were President the Kaiser would have hesiuted for a while (yet the war was inevitable) and for cause. They are persuaded the thundermg Theodore would have warned him not to violate the neutrality of Belgium i and with America and England, with the French and Russians— well, it might have made him pause. That's all speculation but it may be more It may mean the election not of Wilson but of Roosevelt. Let us be fair to Wilson, though; he has persisted ever since in standmg up for rights of neutrals on land and sea both per-sonally and through his ambassadors. The controversy over the Lusitania has dragged on for a year and a half. The sever-est passage at diplomacy regarding it took place only last week, when the President required an answer by the seventh of February, admitting that the murder of Lusitania 's vic-tims was illegal. The Germans substituted a phrase that saved Wilson's face and saved the German administration's face before their own people, as there was a public holiday pro- elaimed m the land when the tragedy was announced. He has pursued what I consider a peevish, pin-pricking policy with regard to the British blockade, mostly while pretending to defy, really to please and placate the hphenates. There are twenty million Germans in the States and votes are the raw material of election and ofBce. Owing to the sea power of England she holds up all boats suspected of carrying contra-band—mail boats with the rest. This may be annoying but It 18 not brutal. Technically it is not legal because inter-national law requires what is known as a close blockade, and England has not declared this because Sweden is only looking for a chance to go in with the Germans; and besides it is as-sumed Grey knows his business. Of course this means that the United States ships a great deal of foodstuffs and also muni-tions of war to the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. This aggravates the English press into a constant chorus of clamors and howls but Grey keeps cool and also keeps Sweden out of the war. Wilson has another trouble on his hands and the name of that trouble is Wm. J. Bryan. He maybe a power in the West but certainly in the East his name politically is hardly ever mentioned. Not so, however, Theodore Roosevelt. You will remember that Bryan is a pronounced pacificist. Mr. Ford is also one. So is Andrew Carnegie. There",
         "were lots m Cuuda before the war. The writer wa« an ardent and convinced one but has since seen the error of his way*. I believe now that nations from time to time, that is, every cen-tury or so just to relax their diaphragms will flght. But I don't eonnt and Mr. Bryan does, especially because Mr. Bryan publishes the \"Commoner\" and places views persistently and clearly before ninety per cent, of the Democrats and ten per cent, of the Republicans in the United States every week. He has for that reason a numerous academic following and for many reasons he also has an enormous personal following. Mr. Wilson will not soon forget — never forget — that on Inauguration Day the tumults and thunders of applause al-ways broke out when the \"peerless one\" was passing. At that time Wilson was known but little, though elected, and Bryan's voice and face were huusehold commonplaces. Now things are changed. Wilson is a brilliant academician and is a shade more adaptable as a politician than Taft. His addresses to Congress will rank with Laurier's and Asquith's, and that is giving him a generous compliment. Wilson, too, has kept his country out of war. The people of thr United States saw their opportunity of bagging the wealth of the world in this war and the American dearly loves money, prestige and pleasure. Everywhere Wilson went there was a chorus of citizens shouting \"Mr. President, keep us out of the war.\" \"I will if I can,\" was the unvarying reply. He, admitted now by nearly every one, made a mistake in not recognizing Huerta, but the long reaches of history may justify his \"watchful waiting,\" while his own countrymen and the unfortunate na-tives were butchered almost to make a holiday. Wilson is now playing at new politics. He is in the West — Kansas and Nebraska — the stronghold of Goliath and he has his sling with him. Bhetoric is his weapon and he is using it lustily. Kansas City gave him an ovation. When he asked for 500,000 men for a standing army the whole audience, 15,000, broke into prolonged applause. There is one word echoing and re-echoing all over the United States now : it is prepared-ness, which means a big army and big navy. These are hard lines for Bryan for the bigger the army and navy the farther fades away the phantom of peace. But Bryan is a power and he owns the West. He is certainly their \"favorite son.\" In \u0026 very important and critical review Bryan's speeches were recently ranked with those of Cicero and Demosthenes. 'That is certainly travelling in nice company. Cicero and Demos-thenes must have been very lonesome waiting these centuries for Bryan to loom up. But I am not denying the charge — only a little Thomastic in my tendencies. Wilson, therefore, in the West is something of a Daniel,",

         "141 were allowing their confidence to consume their wisdom and they soon lost both and their political preferments, too. In a word, the Liberal party was not defeated, it was routed. Many of the Ministers went down in the political cataclysm. It was a great surprise to the Liberals and to Mr. Laurier, whose wisdom seemed to be waning. Naturally he stood highly impeached by his own henchmen who implored him not to go to the country. And there was a reason : the Parliament had two years more to run; and there was no question of getting a snap verdict as there was no political exigency, want of popularity, scandal or the like. John A. McDonald at all events would never have made such a political blunder, for he was to his finger-tips a politician, as well as a far-seeing, shrewd, sagacious statesman. For the past five years Mr. Laurier and the Liberals have been cooling off in the shades of Opposition i a leader especially, even all men, love power and office as well as to serve their country. They have had ample time to consider and conclude that the sands of politics as well as those of time are very shifting, and that it is well not to be too secure, self-satisfied and sure-footed on such a soil. Sympathy says that, but im-partiality and patriotism say that changes arc delightful and more, they are useful, desirable and sometimes necessary. The party system is the best political device for housecleaning that has yet been invented by statescraft ; and it implies criticism and defence and timely exchange and opportunity of office. Laurier was a grand man, but he had been a long while at the helm and barnacles in large numbers will stick and even grow to her sides when a ship is long at sea. Patronage is the curse of politics and we shall assume it corroded the purity of the Liberals, or least it is so charged, as much as it did the Macdonald Tories or even now the followers of Borden. In a word, Laurier went out and Borden went in, and we think the country profits by every such change. Laurier was at the Chateau Frontenac at Quebec when the news came in. He was infinitely surprised of course; but Borden at Halifax was perhaps even more surprised, probably not so much at his election as at the political landslide. Even Wilson who rode in on the same high tide received hardly a more emphatic voice of the majority. Widely various and apposite elements and forces worked in their respective favors, but they must both be dubbed the children of fortune as well as of industry, integrity and desert. Laurier took it like a man and bore up as best he could. For a time he thought and spoke of retiring but his followers would not have it so ; and they say Lady Laurier — one of the choicest ladies in this land, encouraged the ageing statesman \"to stay with the boys.\"",

         "146 history will ever record. It was well that all of them were young and o( strong, physical, moral and intellectual fibre. They certainly needed all th^t and an iron nerve to boot. Mr. Wilson has had the easiest time of it — has had leisure in this season of death even to get married — but nevertheless his presidential career has been robustious enough for his peda-gogical professional antecedents and temper. What with the terrible Mexicans to the South and the belligerents to the East, Mr. Koosevelt and Bryan at home, he has had his hands fall. Mr. Borden, however, has had the actual strain of war to stand, as, when the Empire is at war, Canadia is at war. Laurier is a great phrase-coiner and this one clearly expresses the for-tunes of political ofBce that fell to the lot of the peaceful, pensive, gentlemanly Borden. Mr. Borden comes from the Bast and many wise men have come from there before him. Howe, Tupper, Foster and Fielding all came from down there, and I believe there is no other part of Canada can boast of such a roster of statesmen. He was bom in Orand Pre, aye, \"the village of Orand Pre,\" 80 musical and sacred to the lovers of Longfellow, some sixty years ago. He was educated at Dalhousie College and after graduating took up practical pedagogy for some years, having taught in an academy in the great Kepublic to the South- something of a compliment, as they are in the habit of picking up our best and brightest young men. As Wilson was also a professor it would seem that scholars henceforth may oust and supersede the professional politician. Returning to Hali-fax he studied and practiced law in his own Province. With what success and fortune is made plain by his election when young to the local and federal arenas of public life. After the \"debacle\" that carried both Mackenzie Bowell and Tupper out, and Laurier m, it was up to the Tories to pull the remnants together — to reform the regiments as they say at the front, and at the meeting of the House this is what they proceeded to do. Dynasties aren't in favor on democratic soil and Sir Hibbert Tupper who was on hand and capable enough it is said, was rejected. As always happens in a landslide, political or physical, the good go down with the bad. And there was consequently not too much leadership material lying around. Between a half dozen, however, the choice stood in labor for several days and eventually Mr. Borden was selected and the others fell back into ordinary oblivion, Mr. Borden was well equipped in many ways. First of all, he came from the East where, traditionally, the great men come from. He was besides a constitutional lawyer of repute, and a sound, solid and convincing debater. He was, too, a dainty, exquisite, gentlemanly man, and that is always",

Taking Sam Hughes in and that position was hotly contested, proved a good and popular move. A civilwn in that post now would be a ^ take. But the great difficulty was Quebec. Sir John always succeeded -deally in Quebec because the older generation of the dergy were mostly Conservative. Since his day, was bom the Nationalist movement, and it has been a thorn in the side of both Launer and Borden. And they are yet to reckon with on account of the Ontario French question. Lavergne has been boasting that Bourassa and himself dictated the names of the Quebec Ministers to Borden. Of course that will never be officially known, but it never has been denied. It is true also that Mr. Cochrane invited Mr. Bourassa to speak in Nevv Ontario where the French population was consider-able There is hardly any doubt that it was good politics to use them and get m The fact that Mr. Monk resigned on a Nationalist issue shows how robust was their politics and their opinions. Blondin, the first Speaker under Borden, was",
         "147 particularly eloquent against Great Britain, saying: \"Thay had to shoot holes in the flag to breathe the air of liberty.\" AnJ so Sevigny, the present Speaker, was an out-and-onter against Imperialism. He uses the soft pedal now although he is still the Chapleau of Lower Canada. The Conservative Cabinets at Ottawa have always been of the oil and water sort. They cannot possibly be an amal-gam. Historically the Orange party of Ontario have been the bulwark of Toryism. Then, of course, the JYench are Catholic and besides they always possess their souls and with considerable confidence. So much so that Ontario, when they get properly going as even now in the City of Ottawa, has to take her breath and look forty ways to get out of the impassi. The same situation exists in South Africa and it is even worse in India, showing what experts Englishmen have been since 1776 in keeping the colonies. Oeneral Botha and Oeneral Smuts are in command in Africa; that is the finest kind of politics. Here, too, Mr. Borden instead of mind-ing their prate political and private, took tt: noisy bad boys into the Cabinet and they became actively and even aggres-sively Imperialistic. It is good Liberal tactics now no doubt to derounce the inconsistency of the thing but under similar circumstances they also would find some way of adjusting their political consciences. Mr. Borden has done very well with ttie incongruous, irreconcilable elements that he has to compound, and if he continues to keep the oil and water touching without mixing he can congratulate himself and be h(\u003eppy. It would seem that after a party has been in power for a time they develop a certain amount of cocksureness, arro-gance and autocracy. It was charged that Laurier, Graham, Pugsley and Clark were almost as imperious and commanding out of office as in it, and they were surely a towering quar-tette of Parliamentarians. They undertook, on the navy Budget to obstruct it oft the boards. They had done that before when Laurier mo.ed the six months' hoist to Tupper's \"Remedial Bill.\" In fact it was the fancy feat of both parties from time to time, when something particularly odious or damaging to their prestige or hopes was up before the House. Mr. Borden, however, resolved to put a stop to it for all time and introduced the closure. It was literally a fierce debate and he had to, or at least did, depart considerably from the usage of the House. When the Bill was brought down by the Premier, instead of allowing the leader of the Oppo8'*ion to discuss it, Dr. Hazen quickly caught the Speaker's eye and closed Laurier out.

         "he said graviUtioni he knew there must be some law to co-ordinate the engines of the universe; something behind centri-fugal and centripetal action. In a small way the inventor and the experimenter proceeds along the same lines. Tbere are only a few La Places, Copemicuses, Ptolemies and Newtona Short of that constellation come the crowd who contribute their bit to science, to statescraft, to literature. What then is ahead in science in sociology, in statescraft t very much, indeed. The airship is in its infancy. That de-pends on mechanics; on the motor; and mechanics, too, is in lis infancy. Nor will this century give it adolescence or age.

But we leave this amusing task to scientists who have data in abundance at hand. What will happen to societyl Is sociology progressive? History has something to say to that. We must admit many splendid civilizations have been lost. Splendid palaces in rains where squalid savages now abide argue the existence there in the past of a race of men who stood high in the scale of civilization. The human will which is a law unto itself can abuse liberty, and, like the crab, walk backwards The physical law is reliable, and short of a miracle you can be sure the sun will rise to-morrow.

Ihis moral and physical reconstruction will be the work of a century. And .crtainly there will be no country in the world, bel igerent or neutral, which will not have been so wrenched distorted out of joint by the terrible and titanic conflict of the races and nations, that it will not have to newly adjust and orientate itself, almost as it did when first it began to boast of autonomy and independence. Nor will these efTorts be in isolation. The world is now a neighborhood and neutral efforts must be made to secure reciprocal amenities. We fondly flattered ourselves that we were good neighbors but how nidely has not our complacency been shattered in this wart But whether we are good or bad neighbors, one thing is cer- tam we must strike a modus Vivendi and buy and barter- for no nation now, if ever it was, is a law unto itself, is suf- flcient unto itself. The ends of the earth contribute to our necessities, our comfort, our luxuries and we shall have when protocols proclaim an armistice, to suppress our resentment begin to resume our old relationships, to regain our former order and poise, and settle down to the trades and avocations 01 peace.

They all draw their interest, but before it gets half-way to their hand the Government takes the most of it from them. That means the scrip draws two or even one per cent, i that is to say, your scrip is worth al-most nothing. That looks like repudiation, but it isn't, it's only confiscation. In the case of inheritance the money goes to the Government instead of the heirs-apparent. This all looks like moonshine. But we may be sure of one thing — cheap money, taxation or plain repudiation will be adopted as a means of paying interest on the bonded indebtedness in every one, at least, of the belligerent nations. Men and women, too, are out of joint in civil life. The men have gone to the front — single men, married men, fathers and sons — or they've gone to the factory to make munitions. A social vacuum, like a physical vacuum, is impossible and the women have rushed in — were drawn in or were pushed in — to take their places. Women now are in the fields, in the factories, in theatres, in the banks, on the trains, automobiles, street cars, everywhere in fact, where we were wont to see men. They are ill-suited physically for much of this sort of work, but if they hang on to their new-found jobs they will displace the returning soldiers, and make it difficult for states-men to solve the problems of settlement. The experience, too, will give women confidence and a c n:,''iousness of their capabilities under strain of necessity, anu they will naturally conclude that in times of peace they ought to have more to say about war and peace. They may reflect that men have made a fool of world-politics and that they could not do any worse. A change in the psychology of a class, as it certainly will come to women, will give statesmenship a problem that it will have to face and solve. They will have the consciousness of political rights based on personal rights, as John Stewart Mill put it. long before the war. Here in America it was received rather cordially. Chicago had experimental voting booths in every drug store to educate women to use the franchise. Mani-toba, the first of our Federation, has granted women political equality with men. Probably all of the Western Provinces will follow suit for they seem to follow Wisconsin, the most radical and progressive of modern democracies, except Australia and New Zealand ; and then Eastern Canada will at least con-sider the question. In fact, they have been thinking it over but in these parts they are undoubtedly held back by the fear they have of women on the temperance question. In Eng-land the struggle of the suffragettes and suffragists was some-what picturesque and even tragic in one or two instances. But the lords and their ladies (save the markl) stand in the",

         "England and Ireland will have Parliamenta o! thtat own; they will not be 80 sovereign or autonomous as to tariff and treaties as Canada and Australia, but they will look after their local affairs and do it far better, too, than in the Babylon of Im-perial confusion and blundering at Westminster. Then in ad-dition, as here in Canada, members would not only go to their local houses but also to the Federal centre, and the Provincial and Imperial thinking of the two arenas would fuse and in-terest and improve them all. This would be ideal, but will it be the actual reconstruction of the British Isles. Then there is the broader question of the sisterhood of commonwealths across the sea, the overseas dominions, as they say in England. The status of colony is lost. The growth of the nationhood of Canada was gradual. Gladstone, Disraeli and Salisbury didn't like the word, but Lord North was al-ways in their memory and before their eyes and Englishmen have never forgotten— never will forget— the Boston tea-party. Sir John A. Macdonald made some timid progress in negotiat-ing with Washington, but it was in conjunction with the British Ambassadors. Of course, treaty making, even fiscal, was the test. Goldwin Smith was horrified and said, thinking of his dictionary, that treaty tinkering was sovereignty. Laurier no doubt said \"sotto voce,\" so much the worse for the dictionary. As the wedge was driven in here and in Australia, of nation-hood, the English statesmen gradually took on the new orien-tation until Milper, Balfour and Bannerman came out openly and admitted the national status and Downing Street prero-gatives were gone. \"Thinking Imperially,\" was popularized by Chamberlain and it meant feeling about for new words, new relationships for these disastrous daughters who wore wanting and getting so much of their own way. Of course, ther^ was a time not so long after the loss of the American colonies when British states-nen almost unani-mously thought it would be better to let the colonies go hang, for they would be sure to go anyway, but since a new relation-ship spontaneously began to spring up they have become recon-ciled to the loose affiliation. Before the war the brightest minds in England were busied about a fiscal union fastened with tariffs. This would have made a very mechanical em-pire, and would have robbed John Bull of the advantages of free trade, on which he had waxed so fat to the envy and disgust of Germany. Joseph Chamberlain especially was ad-dicted to this idea; was its protagonist, fathered it, .cham-pioned it. But any embargo, preference or tariff that made the bread dearer in Englana was never favored by the con-sumers whatever political prestige or advantage it promised. Long before Chamberlain died he no doubt saw that his am-",

         "let the sirterhood of commonwealths are awkwardly brewing the new wines for the old bottles. Canada will have a regidar standing army. It will have the double-unit navy suggested by Laurier and approved by McBnde : one at Quebec and the other at Victoria. And they will be up-to-date, with submarines and airships. They will be equipped, manned and maintained at the expense of Canada. All the other colonies, except India perhaps, will be similarly equipped. There will be universal service of the cadet and Bcout sort. The boys will drill and drill and drill, and it will do them good. They will also learn to shoot. Peace or no peace— militarism or pacificism— this sisterhood of nations will take no chances, but will keep in a reasonable state of ef-ficiency on land and sea to protect their shores. It is very pertinent here to consider, in the resurrection of the world the relationships of our sisterhood with the sister-hood to the south of us. Politically we shall remain independ-ent. Economically for mutual advantage, as Taft and Laurier tried to do, we shall draw somewhat closer together, keeping the health and the hope of our own economics — manufacture and agriculture— all the while in view. It is quite possible too, although George Washington wanted no European en-tanglements, that some sort of an understanding between the great English-speaking democracies will be reached. They stand for the same ideals; they are of the one kith and kinj they speak the same language, and ought to make common cause whenever and wherever right, liberty and civilization are at stake. In this titanic struggle the United States are officially neutral; but seventy-five per cent, of the people evidently sympathize with the allies' cause, although there is so much German intriguing and scheming. It is also evident, as the war drags on, that Americans see more clearly to which family of nations they ought to belong. There will also be other alignments and all might as well recognize the fact. One faction makes another, as the Triple Alliance caused the Triple, if not Quadruple, Entente. But after the war is over how will Europe and Asia line up t We mustn't be too sure that alliances and ententes will stay as they are. The Germanic and the Slavic families have long been neighbors and were friends until the present Kaiser drop-ped his pilot Bismarck overboard. The English and French were historic enemies ; now they are fast and panicky friends. The Russians and Japanese are friends; they were enemies at Mukden. What will be the next line-up! I am coming at this: is there any possibility of the Russians and the Germans becoming allies! If they did make an offensive and defensive league they would have a population, counting in Austria and 162",
         "m Turkey, 350,000,000 behind them. It is bootless so to speculate but If such a thuig happened the English and the Latin world would be forced to line up across the way. That would mean North and South America, Italy, France, England and Spain. Speaking of South America is an interesting subject in thu world-reconstruction. Mexico and ^le Latin Republics were very fine hunting grounds up to recently for the German and English capitalists. They were rich in oil and mineral wealth, and were almost entirely unexplored. There has been '?»i. J.\" \"'\" \"^ '*''™ *\" **'\"^ »* federation to the south or the Equator. The potentialities are very great and promis-ing. They have a hundred million people down there. Of course many of them arc savages but then, there are savages who are not there. If a railroad ran from Cape Town to Cairo why not one from Panama to Patagonia? Why not have an exposition every other year in the two countries alternately and give the denizens of the district excursion rates! People who know one another well and understand one another usually don't want to fight. Similarly if I were Asquith 1 would build a road, a double-header, one of steel and one of asphalt from Cork to Belfast, as short and as straight as the bird flies and I'd have an industrial exhibition at either end every year. I'll guarantee Ireland would soon be a united nation, such as Canada is now. Do you think our Canadians would be so homogeneous if it weren't for the G.T.R., C.P.K. and C.N.E.? These arteries let the blood flow to the extremities, and good circulation means good health To return: just now Unele Sam has awakened to the import-ance of South America and he is making love to it very hotly. This winter all the aristocrats and plutocrats of South America have turned New York into a little Paris and the hotels, theatres and restaurants are beginning to think South Ameri-ca s money at least is all right. They will never all go back to Pans. Such is the force of a break in habit. The Ameri-cans knov7 how to appreciate this, as everyone knows that people who are socially congenial will soon find a way to be commercially accommodating. One hundred million peojjle makes a fine market and the Americans are manufacturers. Besides, the best journals in the United States are trying to educate its business people as to how to approach the ffisthetie Latin merchant of the South. President Wilson— and this IS big play— is having conferences frequently to which are invited members of the Southern governments, wherein ways and means are discussed of bringing the two countries closer together socially and economically. The \"watchful waiting\" as to Mexico has done tons of good south of the equator, coupled with a few highly accentuated pronouncements of the",
         "les 41 Preaident ; for down there they were always suspicioiu of the big brother to the North; they thought he would gobble up them and their pie one day, if they weren't good, and he wai kugry. The flacal appendage of the territorial Monroe doc-trine also established confidence in the Latin brotherhood. It meant, forsooth, that Uncle Sam would lend them money on reasonable terms henceforth to develop their territory and the gunboat incidents and the revenue cutter acts would not be of such frequent occurrence. That was the way the old country folk collected private corporations' debts, and Uncle Sam may some day find that the bad boy is still in South America. Unc i Sam intends to bag South America bodily but not politically. Canada to the North is a real good civilized country, and one of the United States ez-Presidents often visits them, likes them, in fact, and gives lectures up there; Uncle Sam doesn't need to worry about it. In the way of world-politics after the war there is an event looming large on the horizon now which bids fair to let the United States out of a difficulty. Of course I don't think the clever Yankees will be absolutely aware, till it happens, of how much they are accomplishing. The doctrine of the constitution (and I must use the soft pedal here as I don't know much about it) explicitly declares that the United States of North America are large enough for Uncle Sam and that they must never become imperial. They were faithful to that restriction for a hundred years but were drawn into the Spanish-American War and willy-nilly they would have colon-ies. That got on the nerves of a great constituency of Ameri-cans as it countered and crossed their traditions. Cuba was civilized by a very eminent Canadian, bom in the United States, Mr. Van Horne, who threaded the island with railways. They then granted it freedom and independence. Similarly now they propose to grant the Philippines autonomy, after paying $30,000,000 to the Spaniards for their rights, indemni-fying the friars and aiding and encouraging education, sanita-tion, and public works. It is chivalrous and diplomatic to a degree to give them a sovereignty which they never before possessed. This is consulting and conserving their own tra-ditions and in the long run it may prove good policy. The Japanese, like the Germans, have an unwieldy consciousness — a conscioi'iness that they are the little Englanders of the East, and they are even now chafing with their narrow hanks. They have a population far too large for the little islands they occupy. The lands of the earth are already jealously colonized. China is full to overflowing and with the Japanese dream of Mongolian magistracy it is policy to let them possess it and expand. Without being Malthusian one cannot cramp",

It is the only way A people, be they never so small, profoundly eonacioua of na-tionhood— larael for inatance— will keep the flres of patriot-ism amoldering a thouaand years, waiting an opportunity to let the flameaTjurst forth again. England's method, at any rate, short of supreme sovereignty, giving peoples autonomy, letting the Bothas and the Lauriers govern themselves is the only way to keep them sisterly and loyal. The experience of Germany in Poland and Alsace-Lor- ■ raine, where with their method of thoroughness and brutality they persistently endeavored to smother the amouldering em-bers of nationality, ought to be enough to warn the ambaa- aadors who will soon sit in conference, to draw a new map of Europe, against again trying that useless and tyrannical experiment. Belgium, if not Denmark and Holland, is the desideratum of the German heart. They have the Teutonic atram. If they would only hand over their sovereignty what a sea coast would not Germany possess. Rotterdam ia as necessary for the Vaterland's ambitions as Constantinople ia for the Bussians or Avlona is to the Austrians. England will stubbornly oppose an Antwerp or Rotterdam base— one Heli-goland IS enough. This is the reason the war will drag on. There is no use parleying till many of the ambitions of the Teuton-Turk alliance are abandoned. England is committed to the conservation of the little countries. That was why ahe sent her expeditionary force to Belgium.

         "Ml War Values— Losses and Gains DEATH U the greatest natural evil in life. Life ia thrown into an elemental panic at its approach. No philosophy can save the situation. Age is some solace. Religion # K. ■.? . \" '*'''* '\"■* \"'y- ^\"* *''«° **•«» '« not natural ; lor JTaith lets into the soul a glimpse of the great white way of the new Jerusalem's lighted city. The soul is intoxicated with the torrents of its supernatural beauty and quite forgeU or despises ' ,, grim monster, which in the struggle with nature is surely straugling his quarry. Such is death to the individual. Be it the flower, the bird the fish ; It IS all the same, death to each, or decay if you will ■8 the supreme evil. The hand of God through nature has granted a very definite span of life to each individual type. Ihe ordinary man will die at seventy : so says the Psalmist. Ihen he drops into the grave like ripe fruit in the fall drops from the trees. Even then it is the supreme evil, not so much per se, as by reason of speculations that are natural and in-evitable to the human mind, as to immortality, heaven, hell sanctions, rewards and punishments. ' St. Augustine, discussing physical evil, illustrates the subject most luminously by presenting to us a child bewildered in a forge, looking at the irons hanging on the wall and lying about m utter confusion. The blacksmith by a natural electic- ism, bom of his trade, selects with comparative ease and quick-ness the right iron for his needs as they daily develop. This physical image brings out his argument most clearly. He con-tends that there is a Master Mind behind the scenes of the universe which, often unknown to us, co-ordinates completely all the apparent contradictions and anomalies that confuse and bewilder our vision. Though impertinent to the point here no one can show that moral evil which is an implied denial of Ood's existence, consequently blasphemy can contribute to a higher harmony which it is not given to man to see. The Creator so co-ordinates the various kingdoms elemen-tal to the universe, that there is a constant ebb and flow like the tide among them, to their several and mutual advantages. The organic and the inorganic act and re-act ,give and get compensation. The breath of the plant is the life of the animal • the breath of the animal is the life of the plant. There is no annihilation i there is no loss of energy. The sum total",

We can easily see and all admit that death is the supreme evil If we consider the individual, but when we consider society It becomes the supreme natural good. It was well said \"One must always die for the people.\" The axiom is limited here by the context to sacrifice or satisfaction for sin. But it haa likewise a universal meaning and application. It is just aa true to say all must die for the people— for society. Society is an ever extendmg telescope, every generation adding a new cbambor widenmg as it goes, to let in more light. There are 1,600 millions, say, in each generation. If, as a unit, they laced death they would do so in natural revolt but they would leave their estates behind, not so much their physical chattels and assets as their quote, their contribution to the intellectual and the moral storehouses of the race, hidividnals may lose the deposit, sections of society may degenerate, but society aa a whole forges forward, because progress is an inexorable law : the law of the intellect, the law of the will, the law of nature. That IS the only way nature and creation can return to the Creator as final cause. Being bom and dying at specified intervals and m the main precisely marked— man at seventy years, the elephant at a hundred and so on, is a most bene-volent design of the Creator's in the interest of society that the inertia, the momentum of its morale and rationale may continually but ordinately increase. Shall we conclude, then that death is th supreme natural evil to the individual and the supreme ni;tural good to society f To die a natural death at seventy, after having spent a devoted and dutiful life is still paying a double debt— life has been at usury— to nature and to society. We return to nature less, but to society more, than we received. There you have it ; evil for the individual, and good for society. But supprse a man dies at thirty-three for religion, the natural evil is greater and so is the social",

         "In, the favorites with the people and promptly received the in-cense of the gods m the open squares and courts of their capital cities. Ancient Rome and Greece and Japan are most notable as giving this reward to patriotism. This may, how-ever, be explained by the nature of their religion, which was and IS polytheism and pantheism. In a more rational way we in these countries put the names of martial patriots at the head of history. And gold is not good enough ; no art is cun-ning enough to inscribe on its pages their glorious deeds. Although it would not be pertinent or logical to discuas it here the patriots of peace have and deserve, a high place m the chronicles of civilization. We have a word much used modernly— pacificism— which by reason of contrast with mili-tarism must be discussed in these pages. It is a cult which was born of the highest ideals. In fact idealism is its bane and Its curse. Men will never become ideal. At least half of them will always stand for liberty to eat, drink, sleep and fight wherever and whenever they wish. But postulating pro-gress as the law of the universe, including society, they peevishly ask has not the age arrived when some progress ought to be made away from the clash of the clans and the wars of the tribes f In theory most men who are civilized are horrified when murder is committed or even when death oc-curs accidentally in a tragic or torturing way. The elemental passion is not only for self-preservation, but for the preser-vation of all sentient life. We have societies which busy them-selves about the comforts and humane treatment of dumb animals and all modern legislatures have given it their sanc-tion. One cannot, however, in the discussion of the values of war— its losses and its gains — credit this sentiment of sym-pathy with sentient being up entirely to Mars or his minions. I think it is rather a permanent quantity in nature itself nature elite and its own estate. The circumstances of war; the horrors, the bloodshed and the miseries only serve to ac-centuate interest and bring out the brotherhood of life and the natural tenderness and sympathy planted in men's minds and hearts by a Provident Guide. Thus is preserved in power and endurance each species put on the earth for a purpose very often beyond our ken. Yet as to this very matter as in most other matters, that are moot among men, they almost by an instinct, fall into two hemispheres, for and against. Sometimes it would seem as if a perversity were planted in reason to balance and retard action so as to give a better fibre to the processes of progress. The slow world of conservatism designed by God in the interests of safety always keepa grumbling \"festina lente,\" make haste slowly 1 And history",
         "170 too often wearing the widow's weeds of sorrow, shows us on her open page the death of society's cherished and tested customs which are superseded by experiment walking in the Illusive grove of false progress. Let us then admit there is in Opposition the spirit of wisdom which calls upon even safety again and again to try, like the elephant, the bridge of progress, the sage design of a Providence deeper than the human mmd in isolation or conjunction can fathom. Let us now pass from pacificism and hiunanitarianism which do so much credit to the human heart, to militarism the opposite school, where the scholars addicted to different Ideals— I shall not say higher— aim at cfBciency in action and strategy; aim at fitness, physical an.! mental— if not moral- aim at the keen eye, the bright mind ; aim at the best in mere animal life; aim at the deep chest, the strong heart, the large muscle; aim at mdomitable power, both of the man and the animal. One who feels that he is civilized, who feels that he has drunk of the wines and the airs of peace has a feeling of depression— of reversion, of collapse at all this He feels that for a providential reason, not clear to him, that conser-vative forces have called a halt in idealism and progress per-haps m the mterests of solidity, and that for a century or so the progressives will have an opportunity of contemplating the ground they have covered and conquered ; an opportunity to make safe, to solidify, to strengthen the trenches they have taken ; trenches that will serve as a point of departure, when militarism, sickening at its sordidness, will again, the disgusted cumulative mmd permitting, allow progress to advance in the sciences and the arts of civilization. Yet militarism profes-sional and improvised, has the stage end will have it for cen-turies perhaps. There is a law in over-doing things that dis-gusts and causes the pendulum to swing to the other extreme— m logic they call it proving too much and proving nothing This might be the medicament to meet the virus of militar-ism that, like a disease, seems able and apt just now to seize onto the vitals of society like a cancer, setting up an indi-vidual entit- of Its own ; to suck into its arteries all the energy and life mtanded for the body, social and politic. Militarism IS tribalism. Militarism is physical fitness and force. Militar-ism is the superman. Militarism is un-Galilean, unideal and uncivilized. Yet one cannot deny that militarism is science M art, IS industry. One cannot deny that immense and pro-found scholarship is consumed in this most arduous of all trades and professions. When one contemplates the commis-sariat of a million troops ; the transport and convoy ; the supply and distribution of munitions; the command, tactics and strategy, he is absolutely amazed and confounded at the",
         "171 ■iir 'ioloisal proportions of the task. And who is not forced to reflect that if this energy, this ability, this science and art were used at the same high pressure in times of peace, in the interests of progress, instead of destruction, what a sum total, what a momentum, it would add to the assets of society in every conceivable way. The commonest thing in the world, although few notice or note it, is for the means to become an end in itself. In fact if all n-eans were personal and intelligent under the eye of psychology and investigation they would reveal like many servants a tendency to upersede and supplant their masters. In the ancient empire the thing occurred so frequently that it ceased to be unique and became ordinary. A military dic-tator ruling a country means the army has superseded society in its civil functions. Again and again the diadem of ancient Borne was up at auction and the dictator was the auctioneer. The sword or the p-stol is for the defence, not for the con-servation of life — food does that. The military in all normal political judgment is the Sword of the state; but when it takes over the crown and the sceptre and the mace, the cancer has consumed the body and will soon consume itself. Another thing supremely odious and inimical to demo-cracy is that officialdom and officers in the army and the navy betray an infallible tende;icy to become a casfe. In England and Prussia and in all countries, aristocratic or democratic, this order of society prevails: the king, the prince, the duke, the baron, the viscount, the general, the admiral. Even in the United States and France there is nearly as much caste and class as there is in Prussia and England. No denying this. If it is good, necessary, unavoidable, and desirable in itself, let us not complain; but democracy instinctively dislikes gold braid and gold buttons as it also dislikes bull pups in car-riages with blue ribbons around their necks. The Canadians were considered a mob in England until the days of Ypres, St. Julien and Festubert, when their fighting saved the day; because, forsooth, the officers off duty would chum and drink and smoke with the men. At any rate this war will bring into striking relief the relative merits both of pacificism and militarism, and as the leaven ia in the dough neither will easily down. Overdoing anything undoes it as proving too much proves nothing. A cumulative subliminal consciousness after this war may find a voice like a volcano even in Prussia, the home of the sword and the helmet. The same consciousness may cry out with one thundering voice for universal disarmament, for perpetual peace and pacificism will be more than a dream and a theory,",

What of Joffre and Kitchener and the Kaiser's general staff and the Czar and Duke Nicholas T If prudence and wisdom mean infinite calculation of the ways and meana to gam victory one can trust all these to surpass, if poaaible, Solomon. I suppose, too, one can run up the stream to the governments behind these generals and general staffs and find that they, too, will use the beat brains in the kingdoms to their best ability. Even the humblest citizen in every one of these contending kingdoms will not sell but lend any asset of wisdom or prudence he may possess to further the advan-tage and cause of the fatherland. Will all these resources of wit and intellect be lost after the wart They will have a tendency to slacken and relax. If they do not our factoriea will run at a higher head of steam than in the past.

Shall we paaa it over in silence t The best definition of it is the fulfilling of the law. What lawt All law — human and divine. The com-mandments of God are the principles of all human laws. Civil law is only the application and expansion of the divine law. It never can be in contradiction or contravention of it. The less said of justice in relation to war the better; it suffers irreparable loss. \"Honor thy father and thy mother\" means in the laat analysis you must honor the magistrate and the king; for the family is the unit of society. It ia implied, too, that you honor and obev every superior, be he never so high or so lowly.

They say he meant the individual. At any rate the atate baa always enjoyed and uaed the power of the sword. Some aects stubbornly atick to the commandment in Its literal aenae. and will not become aoldiers or fight for any country and are conseauently considered disloyal. Theologians usually permit wars that are just and in self-defence Wars that are unjust and wars of aggression they condemn How ever, m admittmg so much they admit the state has the right in that instance to use her eitixens in mortal combat. In the case of crime, too, no sUte yet has succeeded well, short of capital punishment, in keeping her unruly and froward child-ren in check. Murder ia killing with malice aforethought. Manalaughter is killing by accident or rage. Will war have any influence for good or for ill on society or the individual 1 Most probably it will make all men in whatsoever capacity coarse and callous. The wreck of the Titanic made the race reel with the mtoxication of the tragedy. The sinking of the Lusitania didn't cause a shudder. It seemed a matter of course to many ; and in Oermany the children bad a holiday to cele-brate the feat. In the matter of murder or manslaughter war undoubtedly can have no place in our credit account; it ia a loss, a damage and a disgrace. As to clean living, which is the next count in the cate-gories of our canvas, what has been called \"the war babies\" is a sudden and aufllcient answer. The conduct of the Qermana in Belgium as presented by the report of Mr. Bryce's Com-mission seems to place beyond doubt the fact that war leta loose the animal in man. He kills as fiercely as the tiger. He howls like the hyena. He plunges into excesses like a pig. War is lust and sensuality. We shall dismiss it summarily on this count ; as it is unconscionably unclean and coarse. \"Thou Shalt not steal,\" being Mosaic and even Galilean, It IS rubbed from off the stone. Property has always been held aacred by civilized peoples. The sweat of the brow is personal and is always the price one pays for property. That it should be confiscated, for that reason, is unthinkable to all men in",

         "U4 almost absolutely certain. It is well known that every con-stitution 'Ike every man animal, vegetable tree is a growth. Not only that but that ihey are as individualized by local™: cumstances and conditions as man is by matter. Certain forms of governments are called repubUcan, autocratic, aristocratic, monarchic etc But what's in a name! France Is a republic coMtitution! They are different. Prance is really an auto-cratic tyranny Democracy there is dead. An election there is not the voice of the people, it is the echo of the administration's can. England is called a limited monarchy: it is really a democracy. Asquith and the Commons make the laws and in r5 '^ Pe™«°ent and hereditary President. PracticaUy all political Ideas have been bom in war. The confederacy of the United States a new thing then in politics, came into existence m 1776. The thirteen States started off With autono-mies, sovereignties of their own but they agreed to surrender enough sovereignty to make a federation possible. Then piecemeal and by patchwork they fought for or purchased territory until now they have the half of North America n^'l.\" M i*\".* 'e^eration but it is entirely different. The British North America Act is its constitution. It is technic-ally a colony, but now really a nation; if it has sense enough to stay one. Canada has contributed a new thing to political scienee which was not bom in the throes and labors of war She became a nation by bloodless evolution. The treaties with France and the United States, fiscal if you will, settled that. 1 he British ambassadors m these places looked on in amaze-ment while the Canadian envoys dealt directly with the afore-said governments. „^ /\"k? ■*^''''°*. *°* AustralU have similar constitutions and no doubt are quite as individually differentiated as those in our continent washed by the Atlantic's waters. The future alignments of the dominions or commpnwealths within the JSmpire— or confederacy— is now being warmly debated If from the present British House of Commons in which there will be an exact balance numerically between the overseas and the at-home members quite a new idea will be contributed to political science. There have been informal meetings already of colonial and imperial statesmen which were, I understand Sn™ rt-'T^*'™ \"\"J \"dvisory. Something quite different from that has to come. The war debts locally in the overseas dominions will be enormous. But those in the motherland r,„ J J*\"\" insupportable stUl. This body that has been suggested would have to deal with tariffs, rebates, embargoes, preferences and the like intended mutually to assUt all",
         "the f lif ii dominioiia without in any way leaaening their present political •tatni. There will always be great danger in this general couneil of reverting to the colonial condition in which a tax might have to be paid on tea shipped not to Boston hot to Quebec. Treaty-making without sovereignty was new to the dictionary, still that now is an accomplished fact. And some new federation may come after this war between the various members of the British commonwealths that will divide equally between the overseas and the at home legislators the political deposit and powers of the whole. Something new will be worked out in the British Isles that would not have been possible before the war. Ireland, Scotland and Wales will have, no doubt, local Houses and look after local matters. But foreign relations, fiscal policies and war will not be within their competence or jurisdiction. Another matter of political importance which the war it ^ing to permanently affect is socialism. This theory which IS partly economical and partly political has been exploited witii persistence, violence and heat since the days of Bngd and Marx. It's the voice of dissatisfaction and discontent. It is a reaction against the individualism of ^e eighteenth cen-tury. It is now almost cheated of its incentive and objective as the majority of men, even society itself, has also been quietly but strongly running in the opposite direction. Brother-hood, neighborhood co-operation are words in everyone's mouth and consequently tiie speakers in the parks not saying anything new are neglected and find their trade and popularity almost gone. In the twentieth century the pendulum is swing-ing to the exact opposite extreme fron. ^here it was in the eighteenth and those who come after us may find the tide Betting in again in the opposite direction. What it advanced regarding utilities — ^that tiiey should be taken over and ad-ministered by the state in the interests of the people — ^has been done and is being done more fully now — to their hearts' con-tent oi rather discontent, for they hoped to have had a hand in it and to have gotten credit for it. The exigencies of war have forced the governments on the one hand and coerced the people on the other to adopt all their important theories. Everything from com to cotton has been socialized. Every-thing frc-m munitions to men has been mobilized. The iniU- vidual now is a thing, is an instrument, is an asset of the state. This new thing will remain with us till the war is over. After that some of it will no doubt never be revoked. As a political theory socialism, collectivism and the others in modified forms were tried in a small way and tentatively centuries ago. And they tailed, as extreme doctrines are always bound to do. Now that they have been adopted as a military necessity,",
         "IM \"'^'i ^ \"' '\" Po''*'''\"' novelty. Besidea what u really uefal and desirable will no doubt be permanently retained For instance monition factories ought to remain under govem- nient control; in fact all war supplies. Railways, telegraph, telephone, post offices in many countries being public utilities were already before the war in the hands of the government. If and when this socializing tendency goes too far one can trust the Opposition in Parliaments and the free lances in society to go after it with a vengeance and without mercy. ■ -^ '\" *\"'0'\"\u003e'ni\u003c'» the war will overturn the whole fabric of It. Whether to men's profit or loss time alone will tell. Labor and capital, like conservatism and reform, have been mighty forces at work in the fabric of society from its very origin even until now. And there will be or can be no rest. Look at the winds and the waters! They constantly purify them-selves by motion. The air instantly distributes the gases and the water throws down at once ita precipitates. In society, too, by analogy the purification processes must go on. The debase-ment of the coinage and currency raises prices, taxes and wages. Ite purchasing power being lessened, there is only one remedy : wages must go up. Labor has to be fed and capital will have to give of ite profite to meet his needs. There IS and will always bo no doubt selfishness, prejudice and un-reasonableness on both sides. But when the voice of necessity calls out either or both sides will have to give way and coni- promise. The \"interesto\" have always been affectionately protected by the supreme courts of every country in the world and the plutocrate consequently flourish and grow fat. This is no doubt good as labor individually and collectively would be in a bad way only for the employment provided by the or-ganizing genius of capital. The governments of the world dumng «us war wUl have the hardihood to take a quarter or half of factory profite beyond seven per cent, which is con-sidered a fair return for iuvestmente in these R*-enuous times, xf after the war is over govemmente would inue to con-fiscate and decentralize capital by income tai\u003e ,d succession duties there would be lifted off the shoulders «, labor a great burden. The minimum of taxes would be levied on their homes which would allow them a more liberal margin to be used in the comforte and pleasures of life. Henry George twenty-five years ago urged the theory of smgle-tax m the interest of labor, but it has made very slow progress. Our new provinces in the West have been tentative-ly trying it. But conservative and radical minds seem to be about evenly divided on the question. Land values and labor values, land produete and labor producte, are the op-posite assets, that the various schools would tax exclusively.",
