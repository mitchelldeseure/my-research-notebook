While it is a good thing to know all these names, we s|)ell out the word neicn, and news is but the world's hapi)enin, «, gathered from every comer of the earth. Did you ever see the sun rise ?

         "^'^''' 8 WORLD RELATIONS Sailors often find their position on the sea by noticing the situations of the north star and of other stars. Indians and many other people in different parts of the world use the same nic ins ; and boys and girls should be expected to take enough interest in the sky to be able in a short time to tell the east, the west, the north, and the south even at night. But thei'e are times when the sky is cloudy, and neither the sun, the nioun, nor the stars can be seen. How may one tell direction then ? Have you ever seen a compass ? It is a small box \"... which is a little steel bar or needle tliat swings on the top of a pin. V/hen the needle is at rest, one end of it points to the north and the other end points to the south. Knowing these, how may the remaining points be found ? What would you call the point half way between the east and the north ? Where are the south-east, the north-west, and the south-west ? If I were to go out of doors, how can I find the north ? How can I find it at night, the stars being in the sky ? How can I find it in the afternoon, the day being pleasant ? If you were lost and knew that your home was south, how would you find it ? In what flirection does your shadow fall at suniise ? At sunset ? At noon ? W'hen, during the day, is your shadow longest 1 Shortest ? What time of day is noon ? How can you tell from your shadow that it is noon ? W^hen is the sun highest in the sky? Is the sun higher at noon in the summer than it is in the winter 1 What do A.M. and P.M. mean ? What is the twilight ? What the dawn ? In what direction do the birds go in the autumn time ? What can you tell by watching the direction of smoke from the chimneys ? Questions. 1. How lon^ does it take you to walk a mile ? 2. How far do you live from the school house ? the post office ? 3. If you live in the city, how many blocks are there to a mile? 4. Find out as many wavH as you can how to tell which way the wind is blowing. 5. Draw a map of your route from home to school. 6. As the nee\u003clle of the compass points both south and north, how can you tell which is which ? 7. The shortest shadow made by a post is the noon- shadow ; how should you find this shadow? 8. If vou had the noon-shadow, how should you find the one-o'clock shadow? 9. Find the real noon and compare the clock with this. 10. The sun is near the horizon ; how can j'ou tell whether you are looking toward the east or toward the west? THE WEATHER The air, or atmosphere, is al)out us everywhere. We cannot see it an\u003cl yet we know that it is there, for we can feel it blowing against our faces some-times and t)ften we civn see it moving the dust and the trees. When the air is moving along .so that we can feel it, we call it the tvind. Sometimes the wind is so strong that one can scarcely walk A windmill used for pump-ing water to supply a farm,. against it. Sometimes it may blow so hard as to blow down chimneys, and even lift the roofs of houses. Most of us forget all about the air unless it is moving rapidly. But air is of very great value to us. We breathe it. We some-times make it do work for us in wind-mills. It is the air that carries the clouds, and the clouds bring the rain and the",
         "snow. OCCUPATIONS 9 Air may be warm or cold, wet or dry, quiet or moving. When we are telling of these things we are sjiid to be speaking of the tveather. In the summer we sometimes have and they fill the air so full of specks that one cannot see far. Such storms of fine snow often cover railroad tracks so that the strongest engines cann(jt get through. One should also know the winds.

The.se storms may often give us a great deal of rainfall in a short timp, so that the streets are full of water and the ground is well soaked. Some-times during these stornis some of the water falls as solid pieces of ice, oj' hail stones. These may do great dam-age by way of flat-tening and even threshing the grain, breaking window panes, and destroying garden stuff. Sometimes we have heavy rain storms that are cold. The wind may blow and the water may freeze as it falls, so that the trees and the telegraph and telephone poles, the roads and the sidewalks are coveretl with a thin layer of ice. Snowstorms come in the winter. If the air is calm and it is not too cold, the snow comes down in large feathery flakes, which soon cover the ground, the chimney tops, and fences with a mantle of white.

As a rule, our bread, butter, tea, coffee, milk, sugar, oatmeal, and a great many other articles of food are brought to us from a shorter or a longer tlistance. At one time the skins were tanned at ho-ne and the heather was then made into shoes for the faniilj by some travelling shoemaker. It was the .same with the clothing. Now our boots and shoes, our cloth-ing, hats and caps and other things, are made on a great scale i n factories All lands are not good wheat lands.

The most important feature of climate and of weather, the feature we speak of most, is tem/wnitiire, that is. the degi'ee of heat or of cold. If it is too cold for comfort, we ti-y to warm our hou.ses ; if it is too hot, we .shut out the sun's heat and do everything we can to keep cool. We have seen from this brief glimpse at the belts of heat, that the climate grows colder, as a rule, as one passes north or south from the e(juator toward the Cold Caps. It is possible, however, to get the .same changes in climate by going up a high mountain in any part of the world. The upper air is colder than the lower air. This has been proved by expei-ience time and again. .Snow lies all summer on the tops of high mountains. Men have gone up in balloons and have nearly perished with the cold, even in the sunnner time. Mountain climbers alv-ays take extra wraps with them. This i I fa t the boys and girls should keep in ound i 1 their future study of geography. THE AIR Finally, we must not think of our earth a.s being made up of land and water, and nothing else. Our earth is enveloped in a great mantle of air many miles in thick ness. The highest mountain top is not high enough to reach beyond this air, and no balloon can rise so high that it should leave the air. Air carries the clouds which bear moi.sture for the earth. Without air we should have no dawn, no twilight, no beautiful sunset; without' air, the earth, wonderful as it i.s, would be without the faintest .sign of life. (ii-KSTioNs. 1.

         "eon^posed 20 WORLD RELATIONS The Western ffemisphere, which contains North and Huuth America. Australia, a .small portion of southern Africa, and a i)art of .South America arc to be seen. You will also notice that all these point directly to the South Tole. It would thus seem that the gi-eat land mass suiroundinji the North Pole ends toward the South I'olc in thit'e great {joints or tongues \u003cjf land. It would also appear that the great water mass centres about the South Pole and extends northward in three great stretches. One of these is called the Atlantic Ocean. You will observe tliat this ocean separates the Americas, ui' New \\Vorld, from Africa and Eurasia, the 01\u003c1 World. Notice, too. that the eastern part of South America would tit into the great bend on the western coast of Africa were the Old and the New Worlds moved so as to touch one another. Again, the western extension of Africa would fit into the curve between the Americas. The At-lantic is the ocean petjple had to cross on their way to North and to JSouth America. The northern portion is often spoken of as the North Atlantic, and the .southern part as the South Atlantic. The second great northern stretch of water is called the Pacific Ocean, so named from its peaceful behaviour dur-ing the voyage across it of itw di.scoverei', Magellan. What a great ocean the Pacific is ! It ct)vers half the surface of the world. Notice its shape, and name the continents around its borders. The third great ocean is called the Indian, which lies enclosed by Australia, Africa and Eurasia. This ocean stretches but a short distance n!\u003erth of the e(]uator. It would appear from oiu- study of the land and water masses so far, that the greater portion of the land lies in the northern hemisj)here, and that the south-ern heniisplieie is largely a water hemi-sphere. It would also seem that the land extends a little south of the equator in thrie great points, and that the water ex-tends northward in three great stretches. The Kasttrn 11 ■:m inphere.

It would furt' more seem tliat tlio eastern side of the A jricas w'tml\u003cl fit the western side of the Old World,and that the ncjrthern continents have irregular outlines, whereas the southern continents have a very even coast line. These ol)servati()ns show that the land and water divisions are placed on our earth after sonic well-fonnc\u003e\u003cl plan. There is another thing we must notice. It is this— there is such a balancing, as it were, of the land and water, that no great block of land will be found to be balanced on the opposite side of the earth by a great block of land. If we now examine the surface of each continent, we shall not find the land everywhere level, as it sometimes is on the pra\" iess Starting with the southern point of South America and keeping to the Pacific Ocean coast, we shall find a great, rugged, highland countiy seveial hundred miles wide in •some places, and extending all the way to the isthmus connecting North and South America. This region bears the The Pacific Ocean. name (jf the Andes. In North America a sumlai- ridgc, known as the Rockies, extends from the isthnnis to the peninsula at the north-west of the continent. In Eurasia, another great series of highlands extends from the north-east to the .south-west. Highlands of a similar character pass along eastern Africa and eastern Australia. One result of t!..rse great highland regions, so near th- c(«irt, is to divide the land surface of each con-tinent usually into two great slopes, a shoi-t steep sIo{), toward the nearer ocean, and a long gradual slope toward the more distant ocean.

THE NORTH EK.N WOODS THE NORTHERN WOODS South of the cold north lands are the temperate forests of the northern henn- 41 '•*■. The uncleared forests are largely in our own country, in north-eastern Kuro.Kj and in norihcru Asia. The occiifKitions of a forest country are tljos,. of hunting, trapj.ing. and l.nnl.Jring. Ihe annual life of the northern woods is fSiirly.nbundant, and ■splu-re. On the map, page 34. von will see that much of North Americ;, nearly ail ol Kurope, a great deal of Asia and I)firts of South America ami ofAu.stralia are covered, or were once covered, with a growth of such trees as are shown on this page. Much of the surface shown on the map as torest-covered, has been cleared of its trees, anrl agric.ilture of all kinds is now being carried on where the forest used to the furs ol.tained by tlu\" hunter and the trapjier uiv much \"light after. Among the most eommon animals are the heaver. luink, inuskrat. several kinds of fox, the wolf, and the bear. In Canada the hunt-ing of animals for their furs is usually carried on by the Indians and the natives of French an\u003cl Indian blo.,\u003c|. The winter catch is taken to one of the many Ilud.son's hay trading po.sts and exchanged for guns, blankets, traps, nets, tea, tobacco, etc. Lumbering is carrie.1 on in the winter '\"•'ntlLs as a rule, for then the ground is covered with snow which helps to make work in the woods much easier than it e\u003c^uld be m the summer season. In the late autumn or early winter, gangs of men go to the hush where trees are elled, cut into log.s. and hauled on sleds to the nearest river, so that the .spring floods may float them to the saw-miUs down the stream.

South Aniori.-iif North Aiiu\u003eri.'u ; s more coust in proportion to Its SI. . .an liny oth.«i- continent except Euroiic Tlic two most important sea aims are Hudson Buy and the Gulf of Mexico. Tlie North coast is irre-boiiud for the greater part of the year. There are mantr islands in this region bearing the names oi some of the brave men who risked their hves in attempting to explore this dreary sea. The largest opening is Hudson Bay, so named after a Dutchman, Henrv Hndsoii, who discovered it. No one knows how Hudson .lied. He was cast adrift by his crew an\u003cl left to perish. Hudson Bay comnuuiicates witli the Atlantic by Hudson Strait, a channel locked by ice for more than half of each year. As much is said to-day regarding a Hudson Bay railroad, it will be well to bear this ih mind. Neglecting tlie great north land of Green-land, we shall, if we pass eastward, come to tlie peninsula of Labrador, with its bleak, rocky coast. At the elbow is New-foundland, guarding the northern shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. On the southern side of the Gulf is the peninsula of Nova Scotia, one of the provinces of our own country. South of Nova Scotia, the coast i-uus to the south-west in three great curves ending with the peninsula of Florida at the northern edge of the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf coast swings away to the west and south towai-d the peninsula of Yucatan. Blocking the eastern side of the Gulf and s.paiating the Atlantic from the sea known as the Caribbean, are the West Indies, be-hind wliich the Spaniards were so long •able to withstand all attempts to drive them out of Centi-al and South America. Tlie Pacific coast forms a sweejting double curve extending from Alaska, the north-western shoulder, to the Isthmus of Panama. Studv this coast carefully, noting the irregular northern half, the islands skirting the shore, and the great extension known as the Penin-' sulk of Lower California. Surface. A study of the map on Page 50 wdl show two highland regions. Notice vvhat the deep yellow, the lighter yellow, and the green stand for on this map. Th.. larger higher, and broader of the highlaii.! regions IS near the Pacific const, and the. lower shorter, and naiTower along the Atlantic' Besides these, a third highland region, nowhere more than a iiuarter of a mile high, and consisting of very old mountains worn down by the storms of ages into round-topped hills, is situated around Hud-son Bay. The most imj ortant feature of the western highlands is th, range of the Rockv Moun-tains which slope eastward gratluallv and meet the western slope of the Appalachians, the principal mountains of the eastern high-lands. As both highland regions run in a north-ward direction they form a ])arrier to the winds from the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, but no obstacle to the winds from the Gulf of Mexico and fi-om the Arctic Ocean. Again, the inlaiul slopes meet to form the Great Central Plain, a huge area shut m on the east and on the west. This plain in turn is divided into two parts by a low ridge which crosses the continent from west to east in the latitude of Lake Siipei lor. The presence of this ridge causes the plain to slope northward toward the Arctic Ocean and Hudson Bay, and south-ward toward the Gulf of Mexico. The Great Central Plain is made up largely of plain and prairie, and it extends from the tundras of the north to the swampv lands about the Gulf. The jirairies cover the regions watered by the Saskatchewan, the Red River, the upper valley of the Mississippi and tiie h.wcr valley of the Missouri. The i.lains, being higher",

The principul feature of the valley to l)e noted at this sfap' of our work is the presenee of a ehaiu of live enormous lakes, whose waters are carried ott\" to the Atlautie by the niii^hty St. Lawrence. No other lake system on the face of the earth can compare with that of the (}reat Canadian Lakes. Climate. In the map on paj;e 50 you will notice a dotted curved line, the Tropic of Cancer, runninj? from west to east across Mexico. There is another line, called the Tropic of Capricorn, corresponding to this, south of the equator. The.se are important guidinj: lines in your study of geojjjraphy, as they represent the most northerly and most southerly jioints of an overhead sun. Nortli of the northern troi»ic, the noon sun i.s seen toward the south. South of the southern tropic, the sun at noon is seen toward the nortii. The Tropii's of Cancer and Capricorn roughly bound the zone or belt of heat which encircles the earth at the equator, and to which the name Hot Bch or Torrid Zone has been applied. North Ameri\u003c!a lias a ver\u003e' varied (climate, l)ecau.se it lies in so many iieat belts. The Arctic circle surrounding the North Pole shows you wheie the North Cold Cap i.s situated. The Tropi\u003c' of Cancer i)assing through the centre of the (iidf of Mexico shows that tiie southern end of our con-tinent extends into the Hot Belt. The remaining portion — in otiier words, the gieater portion of North America— lies in what is called the North Temperate Belt. From this you will readily understand why our continent should have nuiny dilTerent climates, ranging from gieat heat at the south to extreme cold at the north. Place the school globe so that the North Pole points away from you. Looking at the northern hemisphere you will aea half the equator, but less than half of the earth lines running parallel to the equator. This nu'ans that our winter season has less than twelve hours of suu- ligiit per day. It' yon will now turn the globe so as to permit the pole to point toward you, you will see the earth as it appears diu'ing our summer season. The equator still has twelve hoiu's j)er day of siuilight, but we in our northern homes have much move than this. As the sun moves northward, or, as we say, r'nes liigli' and higher in the noon-day sky, North America gets more and more sunlight and heat, and winter gives place to summer with its long days and short nights. Tile climate of a continent is also affected by the winds which are able to cross the continent. Now, the low, (Jreat Central Plain is open to the cold Arctic winds and also to the warm southern winds from the Oidf of Mexico ; and this is the reason why north winds may go so far south as to freeze the fruits of Florida, and warm winds so far north as to cause plants to grow anil Howers to blossom ai\u003eout the shores of the Anttic Sea. This is not all, for the warm south winds carry moisture up the Orcat Central Plain into Canada, a point that should not be forgotten. What difterence would there l\u003ee were there a bar-rier of mountains acro.ss the «'(mtinent in the neighborhood of the Arctic Ocean ? As the Cordilleran and the Appal ichiau Highlands run from north to south, tiiey cut off much of the moisture which the Pacific and the Atlantic Oi'eans would otherwise send to the interior of tiie ('on- tinent. The Pacific coast is well watered from Alaska to San Francisco, and there is ample rahifail along the Atlantic from the Isthmus almost to the elbow of Labrador. Asa result Pacific Canada has fine timber areas, and the prairie country an abimdanr^e of grassy",

The rivers flowing toward ejieh other down the long interior \u003elopes forming the Oreat Central Plain, mos.ly join to form some of the greatest river systems in the world. plain, the Missouri from the north-west and the Ohio from the east flow into the gi-eat central stream, the Mississippi. The Mississippi has the most important basin in the world. Draining the country from markets. . id in winter as well as in summer, the greater jMirtion of the system is in operation. Vessels can as\u003c-end the Missouri to the K(H'kifS. Vessels can also pass far up into tlie country of the Ohio. Along the route are the wheat fields of the north, the corn lands alM)Ut the mouths of the two main tributaries, and the rich rice, sugar-cane, and cotton lands of the s«.uth. In the northern iK»rtion of the (heat Central Phiin are to be found two great river sys-tems, the Mackenzie and the Saskatchewan. The north -flow-ing Mackenzie Is of very little com-mercial value, as the lower part of its course flows through a most desolate region and suffers from severe floofl.s every summer. These floo\u003c]s are due to the rapid melting of the mountain snows at theheailwatere of the river. The river being still ice-1)ound in its lover course, overflows the banks and inundates the country. Con- necte\u003cl with this river are several very large lakes, namely, Athabaska.

Within i-ecent years there has been a great migration of people from Europe. Some of the new-comers have settled in the cities and towns, but gieat numbers have made their homes in the rich farming lands of Western Canada and the Western States.

South Amenca was explored and annexes] bj- Spain and Portugal; Cen-tral Araencji by Spain ; an\u003cl North Amoiuu largely by Biitain, France, and Holland. Tlie St. Lawrence Kiver was the entry which the French exploretl, and the St. Lawrence Valley l)ecanie the site of the earliest Tiench settlements. Quebec was founded hy Cham- plain in l(i08, ai;d his countrymen made their way up the river to the tJreat Lakes, then across to the Mississippi, and down this stream to the Gulf of Mexico. The Dutch had settlements along the Hudson River in the present State of New Yoi-k, but these Indian* of tlie Ttimpthean Tribe settlements soon passed into the possession of the British, who from 1587 onward had made colonies at several points along the coast between th\u003c' St. Lawi-ence and Floiida, and had, in time, come to o\u003c'cupy the low-lands between tlie Atlantic and the Appala-chians. CJonfiicts between the British and the French took place, the result being that Canada passed forever from the hands of the original settlers into the hands of the British. British settleme:,;.' giadually occupied the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys. British set-tlements were also made across the lakes in the countiy now known u«i the Dominion of Canada. In 1776 the oiiginal colonies rebelled againstthe mother-land, gained their inde[iendence and formed a nati(m of their own, the rnitcd States of Amenca. Cana-dians, both French and British, refused to join in this conflict, remained loyal to the British flag, and at the close of the rebellif)n were joined by many south people who, un-willing to join in the revolt, gave up their jill and came to live in Canada wh\"re they were known as the United Emi)ire Loyalists. The Loyalists sfftle\u003cl in Nova Scotia, New Bmuswick, and Ontaiio, and ])efore many y\u003c'ars had i)assi\u003e\u003cl great num\u003e\u003eers of people from the British Islands came to make their homes in Canada. The present provinces of No /a Scotia and New Brunswick, originally united under tlie name of Acadia, were acfjuired by Britain in 1713. Cape iiieton Island, now a part of Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, still a se[»arate province, became British in 1763, together with the great region com-prising tiie St. Lawrence Valley and the region lying north of the (Jreat Lakes. The Central part of Canada eai-ly passed mto British hands, for toward the close of the seventeenth century the Hudson's Bay Company was formed to trade in the fm-s from the forests and plains of the interior. This company held the land for u[)ward of two hundred years, or until it was sur- i-endered to the Dominion. Manitoba was created a province in 1870, and Saskat-chewan and AHierta became pro\\nnces in 19f)5. British Columbia was settled much later than most of the other provinces. Possession was taken of the coiust portions as eariy as 17{)0, but there was little immigration until the discoveiy of gold about 1855. Canada at fii-st was merely a number of scatte!-wl settlements, widely separated. In time provinces were organized, and in 18(i7 four of them, namely Quei\u003eec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, ai.d New Brunswick were",

         "a 66 A STUDY OF THE CONTINENTS suceet^sion of uneven ridgee, divided by river- valleys, lakes, and swamps. In the southern parts and in tlio valleys, especially in that of the St. Lawivuee, there is a fine rich soil and a heavy giowth of timt»er. In the region exteuduig from Labrador westward to the Great Liik»'s and northwaid to Hudson Bay there is more or less forest growth and con- sideralile waste land. Nfxt come the Great Central Plains, the region of the prairies. This is one of the finest giuin-firowiiig areas in the world, and as yet only the southeni edge of it has been oi»ene\u003cl up by the railways. It ranges in elevation from about 8()0 feet at the east to over .1,(Xin feet at the foothills of the Rockies A ijlaoirr in liritUh Coliwi/jui. The third division is the mountain region, some four or live hundred miles in width. This is a vast area of parallel mountain ridges enclosing deep and fertile river- valleys, and coutuining numerous snow-clad peaks, immense glaciers, mountain lakes, waterfalls, and canons. Climate. The Canadian climate, like the Canadian surface, is varie\u003cl. On the west the warm moisture-laden winds of the Pacific are chilled by the mountains and made to yield the abuufhint lainfall of the British Columhiiiji ociiiHf aui\\ to store, up viist sup-plies in the many glaciers of the (Canadian Rockies. The eastern section, or that part of Canada occupying the St. Lawrence River basin and the Atlantic coast, has a great range of temperature and usually an abun-dant rainfall during the summer months. The central plain rises in three great steppes from a little east of the Red River to the foothills of the Rockies. The first stepjHj is the Red River valley. The second covers the western half of Manitoba and the eastern half of Saskatchewan. The last steppe extends from central Saskatchewan to the Rockies. As these steppes represent an increasing elevation or altitude, tlie tem-perature will also vary with the elevation. The Alberta steppe, though the highest, has its winters modified by the Chinook winds, warm south-west winds which come over the mountains in the winter and the early spring, and tuuke it possible for stock to gi'aze in these regions during the entire wintei'. The whole of this area may be said to have an extreme climate, that is, a cold climate in winter and a warm climate in summer. In the far north there are practically but two seasons, a long, dreary, almost endless winter, and a short, brilliant sunnne •. For eight months of the year all vegetable life is hidden beneath the snow, and the only traces of animal life are often but the footprints of the caribou, the fox, the musk-ox, and the polar bear. Drainage. The princit)al Canadian river is the 8t. Lawrence, which drains the five great lakes. Name these. The St. Lawrence valley is not broad like that of the Missis-sippi, hut it exten ' far into the land, and in this way provides a splendid highway for the country ; while its deep and broad lakes are among the gi'eat navigable watei*s of the world. It is said that more freight is carried upon these lakes in the seven or eight summer months than is brought into London, Englatid, in a whole year.

Indeed, the earliest stoiy of the ( 'anadiau West is the story of tlK\u003e t lade in fui-s. To-day tlie whole country is covered by s\u003c'ores of truding posts, each tiie natural centre of a fur disfiict, and all in toiicii with certuin central stations from wliicli the furs are most readily shipped to Europe. It was tliesc «'arly fur tradei-s who first «\u003ex])l(ii-t'd north-western (Canada. \u003c'ana(lian fuis and forests are iM'Ooinin.s: scan-erand scarcer, and thinner and thinner. The careless handUiig of fire and the presence of great transcontinental lines of railways r ntt Scene in Britith Columbut. have helped to lessen the forests, while sense-less slaughtering without any thought of possible extinction has killed off the buffalo and sadly redu\u003c'ed the beaver colonies. The same thing may be said of our supply of lake fish, and of our game animals Vnd birds. We have been using up two of the most valuable resources of oui- land veiT thoughtlessly. Something, however, is being done on a small scale to preserve our animal life and our fish. Forest preserves where animals may find a safe retreat have been set apart heie and there. Fish hatcheries, by replenishing the supply in our stream.- and lakes, have done something toward checking the wasteful slaughter of fish. Both the East and the West have splen-did fishing grounds. Tod, herring, and lobstei-s are the most imiH\u003ertant i)roduet8 of the eastern coast waters. In the west- em rivers salmon are num«'rous, and fine halil)ut is caught off some of tlie western islands. Agriculture, Lumbering, and Fishing. Although agriculture is the chief occupation of the jteople of (,\"ana\u003cla, oidy a very small part of the land is under i-iiltivation. In the north and north-east the climate is too cold; around Hudson Bay the hard rock is un-favorable ; in the west the mountains largely prohibit the cultivation of the soil; never-theless vast areas remain which may he brought under the plough. As the railways extend and workei-sai-e sui)plied, the amount of cultivated land will increase. This will be greatest in the region covered by the prairie i)rovinces of Manitoba, Saskat-chewan, and Alberta. In the end the most of the land l)etween the Great Lakes an\u003cl the Rockies will iMVonie productive. Whei-ever the rainfall is light, improvements in the method of cultivation will make n]\u003e for this delieiencj*. (Jilts aie grown wherevei- wheat can grow. Fruit, especially apples, is gi-own east and west. Almost everywhere daily farming is carried on, cheese being an important i)ro- duct, and gi-eat numl)ers of both sheep and cattle ai-e reared on the drier western plains. The forested jmrtions ajnount to nearly one-third of the total area \u003c.: Canada, and in nearly all these, lumbering is an industry of veiy great importance. The shallow waters of the, Atlantic coast jneW gi-eat (piantities of fish, cod being par- ticulu, \"y valuable.

For a long time there were several separate colonies or provinces, each having its own government. In 1867, on the first day of July, a union of provinces took j)lace and the Dominion of Canada was formed. To-day there are in this union the provinces of Nova Scotia, F*rince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quelnn', Ontario, Manitoba, Sas-katchewan, AU)erta, and British Columbia, each having a local government to look after the affairs of the province, and all having a central government at Ottawa, the capital of the Dominion, to superintend the general business of the whole countiy. Ii«'sides the provinces there are what are calle\u003cl territories; such regions as the Yukon and the North-West Territories, areas at present munnge\u003cl by the government of the Dominion. * Pupils at this sUige should be given a fairly complete account of the character, resources, etc., of their ouii prorinee.

The pro-vince of Nova Scotia is made up of the j)en- insula of Nova Scotia and the neighboring i.sland of Cajie Breton. Cape Breton is sep-arated from the peninsula by Canso Strait, and almost divided by the long Atlantic inlet known as Bras d'Or Lake, i.e., arm of gold. Nova Scotia proper is sepanite«l from New Brunswick by the Bay of Fundy and from Prince Edward Island by Northumberland Strait, and joine\u003ci to New Brunswick by the Isthmus of Chiguecto. This province is about 320 miles long, by from 60 to 100 mile.s w^ide, and is, with the exception",

The sloj^. facing the Bay of Fun.ly and the Onlf of Ht. Lawrence is on the whole fertile. Thin sloiK^ consists „f ,,,|lin\u003ef hills covere\u003cl with hardwoo\u003cl. In the north, these hills arc \u003c-alled fl« CnlM-quid Monntains and they extend from the isthmus to (ape Cunso. Xortherti ( 'ape Breton is mountainous. The southern part is low and level. No idea can be fonncd of tiie In-auty and the fertility of the interior from the b.)ld and barren api)i'ar- ance of tiie sea coast. From the long an\u003cl narrow character of the province it is easily seen that there are no rivers .,f any ^reat size. The Nova Hi'otian streams, however, are many, their mouths as a rule fortn gi-eat haibors, and their swift currents i»oint to the presence of abundant water power. The princi{)al livers are the Annujiolis flowing into the AnnaiM)lis Basin, an aim of the Bay of Fundy, and the Shubenacadie flowing into Minas iJasin, also connected with the same bay. The interior contains many fine stretches of agricultural land where cattle, hay, oats, apples, and potatoes are raised for the markets of Great Britain mm the United States. The land bordering the head of the Bay of Fundy contains fertile areas j pro-tected by dikes which enable the farmers to iiTigate these sea meadows and yet prevent them from being drowned by the high tides. The chief industries are farming, fishing. n Nova S\u003c'otian ships and sailors are found in every great world port and on every great ftea. Tho Annapolis Valley in Nova Kcotia produces some of the finest apples in the world. In this locality fogs and north-eastern storms are k.'pt \u003c.tF l.y forest-covered hills, ('old and late springs j.revent extra W(mm1 bring formed, while the r^hort autumn sea.son prevents a waste of sap.

Coal and iron are found on the main land ami on ('ais\u003c Bn'ton Island, and in both places are either on or near navigaiile water. Tho island Held is about Sydnev, and the peninsiUar field along NorthlimlsMland Strait and nf Pictou and Spiinghill, where the coal seams are from twenty-five to seventy-five feet thick and the coal of excellent qiudity.

I'lince Edward Island was called St. Jean until altout the year 1800, when it received its present name in honor of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, father of the late beloved Que\u003c;!i Vi\u003c'tona. N()rthumber!an\u003cl Strait divides the island from Nova Scotia and New Jirunswick. This low, beautiful, and crescent-shaped island fomas the smallest province of the Dominion. The re\u003cldi.sh color of the nw-ks and sand on the shore, and of the soil in the fields, makes the rich vegetation look all the more green. Both soil and climate are well suited to fanning and the irregular coast line to goo\u003cl harlKirs and good fishing. Under the strait, between Cape Tonnentine of s\u003c)Uth-eastern New Brunswick, and Cajie Traverse on the island just opposite, a submarine cable is laid, an\u003cl conununication with the rest of Canada is further maintauied by lines of steamers comiecting with tin) Canadian Pacific and Intercolonial railways. Fuithermore, a jKJwerful ice-breaking steamer esi)eciall\\ built for navigating the strait in winter, plies between (Jeorgetown and Pictou. All the inland rivers are necessarily short, but the land being low, the tides flow far iidand, thus making sea-ni-nis of all these streams and adding much to their useful-ness. Fanning is the chief occuimtion of this \" Garden Province,\" and wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, and turnips are grown with great success. Indeed, the three provinces men- tionetl are a\u003clnnrably suited to butter-making and for preparing live animals for export. Cattle from the interior of Cainida are always the better for a short stay among the sweeter grasses of the Atlantic provinces. /\"'itrt JiUwai'l, near VtutrlutUtown. befoic Ix'ing shipped across the sea. Fine hoi-ses, cattle, shee}», and hogs are raised, and the breeding of black foxes has of late years btM\u003en remarkably successful. The fisheries are said to be the best in the Gulf, for the shallow waters about tlu^ island are the feeding grounds of 1, jiuu-kerel, hening, lobster, and oystei-s. The chief manufactures are those having to do with the preparation of preserved meats, cheese, condensed milk, and the jnaking of starch.

The Freiu'h-Canadian inliabitants of Que-bec are known as habitants. These are a quiet, \u003c!ontente(I {H'0{)le, with no great ambi- tio:;, but quite pleased with their lot if they can make enouj^h money in summer to keep them fairly comfortable during the winter. Everywhere one will see the old-fashioned habitant vnllasies, and the ehurcii with its tall spire. The p«)ple retain many old French customs, and they iue fond of danc- .1 rif.w nf' f/it' i'ittf ar ijntiltti' I'foin the t'irt ing, and of singing the old French songs. Time and again they have given evidence of tiieir devotion to the flag which now j)ro- tei'ts them. The French settlements co sist of narrow strips along both ba?iks of the St. Lawrence and of other Quel\u003eec streams. Tht- English settlements of the Eastern Townships, as southern Queliec has been called, are nnicli like similar srttlements in other [wtrtions of the Dominion. The Quel)ec climate, in conseciiience of the grciit size of the province, is iiarunilly varied. The sumniei- heat in the St. Lawience valley oft\u003c'n exceeds 80 degrees, so that wheat, oats, cori\u003e, tomatoes, and grapes are successfully grown. The long, hard winter l)egin8ia De\u003c,'emiw'r, when heavy snow covers the ground. Every river, even the St. Lawrence itself, is frozen over. The Queljec winter has, however, many advan-tage's.

Indee\u003cl, the winter season here .and in (Janada generolly is the season wiien the Canadum people set to work to enjoy themsi\u003elves. What with skating, snow-shoeing, hockey, football, tobogauuing, curling, and sleigh-riding, the winters are thoroughly en.joyed. Is it any wonder that Canaila should \\m a land of beautiful women and brave men f Agricmlture is the chief occu-pation, the nuiin crops being hay, oats, {)otatoes, peas, and beans. The hay is shipped largely to the I'nitwl States. Thoroughbred sheep and ca 'tie, jtarticularly in the Eastern Townships, ar\" becoming more and more valuable. Quantities of l)ntter and cheese are made, a large number of li\u003c n-ses raised, and thousands of gallons of prime maple syrup matiu- factni'ed. ToIkicco is grown in some parts, apples arc largely ex-ported, and excellent )\u003eliiins grow in several counties. Th(\u003e forest wealth of Quebec, is enormous, and the timber-trade conu'S next to agricul-ture as a source of wtMilth. The most important wckxIs are the red and the white pine of the Ottawa and the upper Si. Matu-ice valley. Other woods are m.iple, spruce, birch, an\u003cl cedar. ^Umost every district has still supplies of timl\u003e«r, and the whole Ijaurentian |»lateau is a v;isr forest, uf useeillii-rfor timiter, or for papei- pulp. .\\'nt oidy has Quebec euormous forest aieas, but there iire also a great nnmbi-r of rivers which furnish the 'vater-p'\u003e\\ver to carry the logs to the 8«w milk, drive the saws,",

Of what use is each of these minerals and how i-; eadi olitained f The Canadian cobalt and silver district, in which the new mining town of Cobalt has sprung uji, is situated in the Nipissing country alKiut a hundred miles north of North Bay. These valuable metals were discovered by Indian hunters, but white people soon profited by the disco veiy. The Indians, who were accustoiiuHl to paddle along the shore of a small lake, left their canoes and searched for a mineral substance from which they made bullets. Some white men learning of this, investigated the move-ments of the Indians and at once staked out claims. Such is the story of the disi-oven-. At all events, the early French e,\\plorer^ knew something of the silver traces of this region, and this knowledge possibly came from an Indian source. From the nickel mines of Sudbury th'' world is furnished with most of its supply. Nickel is used in making cooking utensils, and in a nund)er of other things.

No province in the Dominion provides Wetter conditions for work anil for play, and of both Manitol)ans take tlieir full share. Only a small i)art of tlio western fanning land has, thus fai', been occupied and cul-tivated. Keccutiy, many thousands of im- tnigrants have been (oinin;; to make new homes on the prau'ies. Some of these people come fiom the countries of Europe). Othws have come from the UnUed States, being at-tracted to our country by the cheapness of the land, Its fertility, and our excellent chmate, and government. It has been estnnated that the great agiicultural teriitory of \\V.\u003esterii (^auada, which was once regarded as nearly worthless, will yield enoui!;!) food, when fully developed, to support a population as large as the present poi)idation of the Uiuted States. Both the .soil and the climate of Jlanitoba are favorable to agricidture, so that the most imi)ortant industiies of the country are connected with farming. The principal grain is wheat, and Matiihha \\o. 1 Hani is famous the world over. In addition to wheat, oats and })arley are grown ; Indian com for garden puiposes is successfully raised, and a considerable acreage of flax is cultivated. Root crops and garden stuffs of all kinds are grown in large quantities. The larger fruits such as apples are being experi-mented upon with much success. The small fruits such as domestic currants aiid gooseberries and wild strawberries, high bush cranben-ies, pin cherries, wild plums, and raspberries ripen eveiywhere After threshing, the wheat and other grains are taken to town, stored in high buildings called elevators, and afterward shipped by rail to the flour mills of the province or to Fori William and Port Arthui. Mixed farming is becoming more and more general and dairy farming and cattle raising are receiving more attention. The Manitoba lakes abound in whitefisli, liickerel, and sturgeon. The annual catch is large an\u003cl a profitable trade with the New York and Chicago markets has been estab-lished. Much of the nortliern country is covered by spruce foiesis, and large numbers of luinbermen are employed in the .saw mills ;it \\Vinnii)eg, Selkirk and other jilaces. Manitnl)a is not rich in minerals. Lime-stone for building i)urposes is found in abundance at Stonewall, Stony Mountain, and at Tyndali. Lime kilns are kept l)usy burning the limestone into cpiicklime. Oood gypsum is found north of Lake St. Martin ; and many brick yards give e\\ndence of excellent brick clay.s. The manufactures of Manitolia ar\u003c' only in their infancy and are largely those coii- nect\u003c\u003e.l with the chief industry of the province. Almost eveiy other village has a flour mill. Machine shops for the manufacture of farming implements are establisheti at Winnipeg and Brandon, and goo.1 sand for the production of glass is obtained at Beausejour. At the present time there are four great railway systems operating in Manitoba— The Canadian Pacific conne\u003cting Wiuni[)eg, Portage la Prairie and Brandon, with branch lines to many other important centres ; the Canadian Northern, with many of the same connections; the Grand Trunk Pacific, and the Great Northern. Wiunijieg, the capital and chief commer-cial centre of the province, was, thirty years ago, .simply the Red River Settlement,'con- sisting of a walled fort at the .iunction of the Assiniboine and the Red, and a straggling line of farms fronting both streams. To-day Winnipeg has a pojuilation of ir)0,00().

North of Selkirk, at the south-west comer of the lake, are the sum-mer resorts of many Winnipeg people. Port Nelson and Port Churchill, on Hudson Bay, may some day become important seaports of the Canadian West. Neepawa, at the northern border of the lieautiful Plains, and south of the blue-roiored Riding Moun-tains, is a town of cousiderabh* size.

Saskatchewan (liaphl lUvcr). The prov-ince of Saskatchewan is tiie middle one of the three prairie prorinns. On the east is Manitoba, Alberta is on the west, the States of Montana and Noith Dakota are at the south and t'ae North-West Territoiies at the north. Ij length Saskatchewan is about 750 miles ; its breadth vaiies from 4(M) miles at the south, to about 250 miles at the north. Saskatchewan is midway between the sister provinces east and 'est with respect to surface and to altitude. Its average height is about 1,600 feet, and its surface is slightly more rolling than is the surface of Manitoba. Its rivers show deeper channels, and groups of scattered hills give the prov-ince considerable diversity of surface. The second prairie Pteppe ends about half-way across the province, while the third, or Albertan steppe, continues the rest of the way. The chief elevations of the southern portion of the province are situated on the edges of the second prairie level — those to the east being the Porcupine Mountains and the Pasquia Hills, and those to the west the Dirt Hills, the Coteau, Bear Hills and Eagle Hills. Other detai-hed hills are Moose Mountain, Touchwood Hills, Wood Moun-tain, and the Cypress Hills. North of the North Saskatchewan River the land is more diversified. Wooded areas become more corhmon, the timber is larger, and a glance at the map will show how well the countiy is watered by lakes and rivers. Comparing the south with the north, the lakes are few and are outside of the general drainage. Many of these lakes are alkaline, and some of the more important are Johnston, Last Mountain and Big Quill. At the head of the Churchill, a river flowing through Manitoba, and emptying into Hudson Bay is a chain of lakes, chief of which is Lake Clear. To the north ai\"e portions of Athabaska and Reindeer Lakes, and all of Lake WoUaston. With the exception of the alkaline lakes, all are usually well stocked with fish. The province slopes easterly, or a little north-easterly. The Hudson Bay receives the greater amount of the drainage. The northern part lies in the basin of the Mac-kenzie, and a small strip to the south forms a part of the Mississippi basin. Tho ohief rivei-s flowing east are the Souris and Qu'Appelle; the North and South Saskat-chewan, rising in Alberta, and flowing into Lake Winnipeg; and the Churchill. The Battle River and the Red Deer rise in Alberta, and flow into the north and south branches of the Saskatchewan",

The south-\\v..st.'in |.ait of the province comes under the iiiliiicnce \u003c\u003ef the Chinook winds. The winter season is usually steady and the snowfall fairly heavy. Hi)i,'h winds are not common in winter, but when they do come, severe blizzardy storms are the lesnlt. The average rainfa'll, perhaps a little less than that of Manitol)a, is between 15 and 20 inches and the bulk of it falls between Aj.ril and September. The climate on the whole is much the same as that of Manitoba. Croj)s develop rapidly aiid the ripening process is helped by 'the long, bright sunshine and the dry weather of t\\w haivest season. Like Manitoba, Saskatchewan is a great agricultural country, four people out of eveiy five being engaged in some foim of farming. This fanning is usually carried on on a large scale, and steam and gasoline are commonly used. In general the soil is wondei-fully fertile, and, with the excef)tion of cei-taiu alkaline wastes peculiar to all the prairie provinces, yields large crops of grains, roots, and grasses. Threshing is done in the open, and the quality of the wheat is No. 1 Hard. Barley, oats, and flax grow well ; the yield of domestic hay is lai-ge, and the low places of the prairie furnish great (inantities of excellent native hay. Natural-ly, most of the farms are still south cf the Saskatchewan, but the open stietches to the north, whei-e the soil is good, indicate the gi-eater farming operations of the near future. The park didrktx, or tree-covered lands, ai-e not as easily broken as the open prairie, and stock-raising is at present best suited to these areas. The south-west corner of the province was for many years looked upon as adapted to gi-aziug and to this alone, but a better ki.owledge of the conntiy and the introduction of drti-farniing, \\n 1. d, where possible, of irrigation, have ••hanged even this region until the open rami, xs, disappeaiing and the homesteader is taking possession. Ranges still exist, but large holdings are bec\u003cmiing less and Ws possible. The south land is almost entirely open prairie. Patches of brush and lijxht timber grow south of the North Saskatchewan. North of the river s,.lendid timber is found ai d the lumber industiy has become a veiy important one indeed. The timber is white and black spruce, jack pine, tamarack, and birch. The centre of the timber industry is Prince Ali)ert. Sheep ranching in Satkntcheivav. The northern lakes aliouud wUh a good quality of whitefish, pickerel, pike, and sturgeon. The fishing takes place largely in the winter .season. After the province is supplied, the suipl.is is shipped to the south and to the ea-st. The fur ti-ade of Saskatchewan is still important. Prince Albert and Battleford are the prmcipal fur centres, and the chief furs are those of the otter, beaver, mink, wolf, bear, and musk-ox. Tho Souris district in the south-eastern part of the province contains lignite coal, which is mined in paying quantitie.s. There are flour mills in almost eveiy town, and pressed brick works and cement works are common. Three railway companies operate lines in Saskatchewan. The Canadian Pacific",

Itegina, on tiit; main line of the Cauiidiau Pacific Railway, is tlu\u003e capital of Saskatch-ewan and the distributing centre of u wide stretch of country. Its schools, churches, and other public buildings are excellent. (Jitij Hall, Reijitui. On the banks of a partly artificial lake are the New Parliament Buildings of the province. The city is well paved, owns its own utilities, and is the hoadquartei\"s of the Eoyal North- West Mounted Police, Sa.skatoon is an important railway centre on the South Saskatchewan. The facilities of this centre for distribution could scarcely be improved, and its growth from a village to an important city has ill taken place in a few years. Around Saskatoon is a fine farming district, and here is located the Provincial University. Moosejaw, on the main line of the Can-adian PacMtic Railway, is also a railway centre of great importance. The countiy surrounding this city is well settled and noted as a wheat-producing region. Prince Albert, on the north braiK'h of the Saskatcjhewan, is IxiautifuUy situated, and is the centre of the trade in lumber, fish, and furs. E'ower is Ijeing develojted from the Saskatchewan rapids east of the city. The surroun\u003cling coiuitry has a deep black soil of great fertility. Indian Head, on tiie main line of the Oan- adiati Pacific, east of Regina, is one of the oldest and wealthiest towns of the province. U.'r(, is situated the Dominion Govern-ment Experimental Farm. Swift (.'urrent and Maple (Jreek are the most important towns west of Mcnisejaw. Estevan, Alameda, Oxbow, and Caruduff are growing towns in the rich south-eastern part of the jirovince. Other Saskatchewan towns are — Weyburn, Areola, (Jarlyle, Wat- rous, Outlook, Yorkton, Battleford, North Battleford (now a city), Kanisiu-k, and Melfort. Alberta. This, the farthest west of the praiiir itriivi, rs, lies between Saskatchewan and British Columbia, and extends some 750 nnles from the United States Iwundary to the North- West Territories. At the south Alberta has a width of 200 miles. At the north it is double this width. Southern Alberta, or that j)ortion of the province lying south of the north branch of the Sas-katchewan River, lies largely in the third prairie level. Outside of the mountain district, this part has an altitude ranging from 2,000 to 4,(X)0 feet. Th. surface is more dee[)ly cut by its rivers than is the surface of Saskatchewan, or the surface of Manitoba. Why should this be the case? ' roups of hills, such as the Hand, Beaver, blackfoot, and part of the Cypress Hills occur as in the i?eighboring province, and coulees run back at right angles from the rivers far into the prairie land.

There are no lakes of importance in the south. The few that exist are simply shallow basins which rise and fall acc.i-ding to the wetness or the dryniess of the season. The lakes of Cetitral Albeita are more inipoitant and will become, no doul)t, of consideiable value as summer resorts. The northem lakes are mostly connecte\u003cl with the general drainage and form a part of the Athabaska basin. Southeru Alberta is treeless except in the mountains and along the river bottom lands.

The chief tributary of the North Saskatchewan is the iSattle; those of the south iiraiieh are the How, the Ked Deer, and the Helly. The climate of Alberta is usually spoken of as extreme, but the range of lein|M'rature is not as great as that of Saskatcln-wan and Manitoba. The summer seasons are not atteinled by exce-sive heat, the nights are cool, and the winters broken by the Chinook winds. The rainfall is from KJ to IS inches annually, ami the greater jiart of this takes l\u003elace during the months of .Mav, June and July. Alberta is a great agricultural land, with interests suited to the rancher, the stock- grower, the dairyman, the grain-grower, the iiTigator. and the market-gardener. The country .south of the Canadian Pacific main line, and to a lesser degree for ii hundred or jnore miles north of it, was formerly an exclusive ranching laim where the nature- sowed short grasses supplied food for the stock sur .jier and winter. For some yeai-s this region has been gi-adually invaded by the settler and the land changed to a grain- producing ai-ea. Here is ■ \" e dry-farming is followed with marked success.

Large parts of the province are underlaid with coal, which is found a few feet below the surface, and fi-equeuiiy \"crops out\" on the banks of creeks and rivers. Coal mining is largely cairied on in the south at Taber, Lethbridge, Frunk, etc., and large 'toal fields have been discovered recently in the district adjoining the Grana Trunk Pacific. Gold is found in the NorVh Saskatchewan sands ; oil wells have been sunk both in the south and in the north ; and gas for fuel, light, and power is found at Medicine Hat.

Fust, there is the character of thei\u003eeople ther^selves. The Americansmay be considered as among the most inventive and the most progressive peoples of the world. But even inventive }H'\u003c\u003eple must have had a good chance. Their countiy gave them this chance. Let us see what this means. The United States occupies the centre of the Noi-th American continent, and is there-fore free from much of the severe winter weather of Canada. How may this help ? It is compact in form and covers an area extending from Canada to Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is well situ- ate\u003cl for tiade, for on the Atlantic side the coimtry is withui a few days' sail of the chief Eui-opean ports, while on the Pacific it has easy access to (Jhina, India, Ja[)an, and Australia. Between these coasts is such a wonderfully ] productive tenitoiy, and the commerce of the covmtiy has gi-own so rapidly, that the United States may soon stand as the first conuneivial countiy in the world. What are some of these products ? Between the Coidillei-au highlands of the west and the Appalachian highlands of the east, is the wide and fertile valley of the Mississippi. Into this gi-eat stream the Missouri from the north-west and the Ohio from the north-east empty. East of the Apjialachiau range is the fertile Atlantic plain. Beyond the Rockies to the west are the Pacific states, with their mild climate and theii- fertile fields. Like Canada, the United States is a land of many homes. Its plains and its valleys aiv dotted with towns and cities, and the whole laiul fi-oin east to west, and from noi-th to south, is bound to^a-ther by a netwoik of railroads. To the north-east, in the states bordering Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, and to the south of British C;olumbia, are the fine forest lands of the United States. Wliat industries will likely be canied on in these parts ! The Appalachians are rich in (•(jal, iron, and petroleum. Petroleum was (Uscovered about sixty yeai-s ago in the state of Pennsylvania ( Penn's woods). Your teaeher will tell you about William Penn and his dealings with the Indians. Since then hundreds of wells have been l)oretl and tht' oil refined, and either ship{)ed by rail over the countiy or taken by iron {tipes to Philadelphia and sent abroad by ships. Pennsylvanian hard coal is taken by the boat-load up the lakes from Buffalo, and from Cleveland on Lake Eiie to Fort William, and afterward by trains to Wumipeg and the West. Without coal and iron how could we provide the machmery so nee\u003clful on the farm ? Pittsburg, m Pennsylvania, is the greatest iron manufacturing centre in the New",

You will notiic on your map at this j)oint how near Africa and Europe are to ea«'h other. People at one time wei-«' afraid to pass beyond thestf points into the unlniowii Atlantic. The Strait gets its name from u lofty i)romontoiy, the Koek of Oibraltar, which stretches out into the sea on this i)ait of the peninsula. This rfx-ky }ilace l)elongs to Gn\u003eat Biitain; in fact, it is liritain's only possession on the mahilaud of Europe. It commands the entrance to the Mediteiraneau and has often been called the kei/ to this gi-eat sea. On the land side the roek rises m 1704 and, though once In'sieged by an enemy for iIuih' yeai-s, has remain(^l in our possession ever since. In ancient (hiys the M«Hliterranean was the most im|K)i1ant .sea in the world. Along its shores many of the great nations of his-tory n se into glory and wink into ob' vion. The Mediten-an- ean separates and yet eon- ne\u003c'ts EurojM', Africa, and Asia. It is dividwl by the Italian Peninsula into two regions, an eastern and a w\\stern. The \" blue sea \" is i , term often applied to the Meditemuiean.

These islands have belonged to Britain since the year 1800. Thty are (juite small Imt are yet of thi' utmost importance to us.

Loiifz;. lonfj ago there was in Asia an agricultural people called tln^ Aryan, or vohic family. These peojile were attacked and driven out of Asia toward the west. In tuni they drove away the jieople fomid along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, but were again driven t'ai-tht\u003er to the we.st of Em'ope by new invadci-s from Asia. Tlieir dewrendunts, called Kelts, are to-day found in Wales, the Highlands of Scotland, and the West of Ireland. The jieople who drove tho Kelts out and took their jilaco in southern Kin-oite were called the U'omance p\u003cH)p]o. Their descendants now live in Portugal, Spain, i)arts of Fi'aiice. and in Italy. After the I.oniance trihes. aiiotiicr horde, the Teu-tons, a ract\u003c of tall, fair people, came and settled in north-western pjurope in the countries now called Norway, Sweden, (Jer- niany, Ilollainl, B.-lgiiim, Switzerland, and port ions (»f the Mritish Isles. While the Teu-tons were settling, another Aryan tribe, the Slavs, spread out across Kussia, \u003c{recce, Ser\\na, Bulgaria, an\u003cl Mont^'uegi'o. A war-like tribe of the yellow type settled in Turkey. The .Magyars, an Asiatic race, settled in Hungary; and the Finns, another branch of th(* yellow race, st\u003ettled in northern Eu-rope. The great race of Kurojie and the gi'eat rv.ii' of the worhl to-day is the white race. With this glimpse of Eurojie as a Avliole, let us now study the different countries sep-arately and learn m\u003c\u003cro of the iKHijile and of what they are doing. GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND The I'liited Kingdom of (iieat Britain and Ii'cland is the name given to the region commonly known as the British Isles; but this long name is often shortened into the Uiiiti'd Kini/iloiii, which we shall us(\u003e. Th(» I'nited Kuigdoni is mad(\u003e uj) of tho large ishinds of (Jreat Britain an\u003cl Ireland, and about five thousand smaller islands near their shores. Though small in size, these islands are the heart of tlu* gi-eatest empire the world has ever s(H'n, an empire which has been built up liy Englishmen, S(-ot\u003c'hinen, Ji-ish- nieii, and Welshmen ; it covers about one- fifth of the land surface of the world; and it has under its rule one out of every four persons of the whole human race.

Indeed, the Britisli Isles were for (-(nitui-ies the battleRi-ound of English and Welsh, fhiglish and Irish, and English and Scotch. Ireland hccainc a pai't of the British dominions in 1172, but tht» complete union took itlac(\u003e in 1801. Wales entered in 1282, England and Scotland came under one sovereign in ]\u0026)'.], and the parliaments of both countries were united i)i 1707. Now all these countries send nieml)ers to a cnui- mon parliament at London, and ail recognize a\u003c'ommou sovereign. King (Jeorge the Fifth. The riiion .lack, the national Hag of the United Kingdom, lias been formed out of the flags of England, Scotland, and Iri'land, and now waves over all our fortresses and on all our ships of war. ( )ur mei-cliant ships carry it to show that lliev are British ships, and many of our schools lloat it to teach our children that it stands for fair play and even-handed justice. At jMiace at home, Britain started out to build an emj)ire. (Jther nations, notably Portugal, Spain, France, and Holland, had already taken to the sea. Columbus, acting in the service of Spain, had discovered a New World. Portuguese sailors had pushed their ships farther and yet farther ilown tiie west coast of Afiica. Bai- tholom«'w Diaz had at last rcmii.led the southern end of Africa in 148(5, and King .lohn of Portugal ' ul called the Cape thus rcmnded, Jio CajM' of (lood Hope. In 1407 Vasco da (Jama round- ' the CajMi and reached Imlia, tli jyland of those (hiys. France and Holland had followed Spain and Portugal in the business of getting new lands. In th(! course of time England also became interested, and s\u003cx)n had a good gi-ip of Ameiica and a foothig in India. But England had to win th(* control of the seas before she could fe(\u003el free to devote herself to the s»'ttlement of new countries, in 1588 Drake helped to defeat the Span-ish attempt to concjuer England by senduig a great (leet which they called the \" hnincible Armada.\" Since then the Spanish mivy has been but a sm.ill thing on the waters of the woi'ld. In the seventetnith ctMitury Admiral Blake destroyed the Dutch tle«\u003et, and in 180.\"), at Trafalgar, Nelson ovt'r- came the fleets of Frani-e ami of Spain hi a crushing victoiy. These three men lived for England, loved their native land with an intense d(\u003evotion. knew her, believed in her, and made her greatness their own. The United Kingilom has since been the mistress of the seas, and has thus been able to extend her dominions by purchase, l)y treaty, by settlement, and by",

One of these is a streum from the north, the Negrc ; the other foines fi-oni the south, niul is called the Madeira. In the basin of the Nejcio are to i)e found some of the finest Brazil nuts, or \"nigger toes,\" in the Amazon valley. The upper watei-s of this rivei- have their rise in the divide separating the Orinoco from the Amazon. At high water - a red union of the two givat river-systems is said to tak(* place. The Madeira river also effects a union with the Parana of the south, when the low divide separating these streams becomes flooded during high water. In the lower Amazon valley, i)alms, figs, and bamboo aio the j)rincipal tree.s, ai'ound which .enormous creepers twine, and from the branches of which beautiful orchids linng. Wild i-ul\u003eber trees an* also found in this valley, and irom this a very important industry arises, an industry of very great value to people force.1 to use rubber goods of various kinds. Crude rubber is gathered by the Indians here and there throughout the valley. The rubber tree grows best where the land is Hooded a part of the year. It is a large ti-ee, with leaves somewhat like ash leaves and with a smooth bark. The gatherer makes a gash in the tree and collects the thick milky juice in a tin cup or a gourd. In each cup a few tablespoou- fuls of liquid collect. This is all gathered and taken to a place where it is smoked over a fire of palm nuts. The nuts are placed under a sheet-h-ou cone with a hole in the top, and several holes in the side to let out the dense smoke aud let in the air to keep the fire burning. A small paddle is then dipped into the white liquid, immersed m the dense smoke, and constantly turned about so that every bit of the liquid will come under the a-^tj-ingent effects of the smoke. The liquid rubber hai-dens, blackens and thickens. Fresh liquid is added and the process is continued until the mass of rubber becomes unwieldy and is removed by slitting the rubber n a \u003c down one side of the paddle. Crude ru ,ber is made at various places hund-eds of miles up the river and taken finally to Para, quite a modern city, situated near the mouth of the river. From Pa. ■ the rubber finds its way to all the important northern countries, where it is made into rubber boots, coats, bicycle tubes, etc. In the upper Amazon valley the cinchona tree is found. This is the tree which pro-duces the quinine of commerce. Indians gather the bark of tht» wild trees and carry it on their backs to the markets. Planta-tions of cinchona have been started in vari-ous countries where the climate and soil are similar to this part of South America. Why is the Amazon valley not covered with Jjeautiful farms, where the banana, the manioe, maize, the sweet potato, and many other useful food i)lants will grow! Think of the woi-k requii-ed to clear away such a tangle of trees. Think of a region whei-e the sun beats down all day so that even the natives do not care to work during the noon hours. Think of a land having such an abundance of rain that the forest floor becomes one great endless swamp. Is such a region a suitable home for the people we are acquainted with? Many spots in this valley yield the things mentioned, but the valley as a whole is left almost as nature made it, a gi-eat mass of trees and climbing plants, a suitable home for numberless alligators, boa-constrictors, long, tailed monkeys, birds of splendid colors, and insects of all descriptions. The Orinoco is about 1,500 miles long and the main stream is navigable for up-wards of 1,000 miles. On the upper waters are immense grassy plains upon which thousands of cattle feed. These are reared for their flesh and their hides, which",

Why should it be jilaced near the lower end of the valley ? This city is called Buenos Ayres (good winds), and it well de-serves its name, for it is considered among the healthiest cities of the world. The population of Buenos Ayres more than a million. The picture will give you some idea of one of its principal corners. At Buenos Ayres all the for-eign stuff connu),- into the country is collected and distributed by the numer-ous railways leading west, north-west, and n()rth, and also by the Parana river, (n no portion of South Ameri.-a is rail-way progress more advanced than in the Aigentine Hepiiiilic. a fact no doubt due to the level character of the land and there-fore the absence of deep cuttings and heavy emltankmeiits. These railways collect the wool, beef, hides, bones, tallow, etc.. meant for export. The ju'reat drawback to the -| \u003city is the amount of sediment poured into the La Plata. (Quantities of this are constantly set-tling in (he harbor, iiiiil steady dreilg- ing is necessary to keej) the water deep enough to (loat the larger oceau boats safely.

The northern counti-y, the region marked on the map as El Gran Chaco, is the \"wild west\" of Paraguay.

Indeed, without the coffee jjlanta- tir)ns stretchinj; out several hundred miles in every direction, the Qitrcn of the South as it is called, would lie hut a small place. To reach the coffee plantations we must po through a very rugged country, over jilains covered with grass, through clumps of palms and through forests of haidwootl trees; past hauana plantations aud orange and lemon orchards until we nwh the ttxl lands of Hijizil, the famous coffee soil of South America. Most of the coffee is gmwii on large I'lantations, some estates having millions of trees set out. The whole farm is covere.1 withamantleof green, the hushes are laid out in straight lin.-s. and the coffee plants lire in different stages of growth. A great deal of lahor is rc.uircd to raise coffee suc-cessfully, and upon one farm may he found four or five thousand men. women, and children at wr\u003erk.

         "ii 142 A STUDY OF THE CONTINENTS out the uuknowu spots of the earth aud open trails tlirough forest, mountain, plain, and sea,— surely a study of Geojrraphy should be worth one's while. Fifty years after this memorable voyage, Sir Francis Drake covered the same gi'ound and exi)erionced pretty much the same in-conveniences; but this is a story you should know for its own sake. Perhaps your teacher will tell you about it. Since those eai-ly voyages theworld has been eircunmavigated, as it is called, very many times, and to-day no one thinks the journey other than a very pleasant trip. The Strait of Magellan is much used by steam vessels, and Punta Arenas, or Sandy Point, at the extreme southern end of the mainland, is a coaling station for all such ships when on their way from ocean to ocean. Sailing vessels have to go around Capo Horn, usually a rough trip on account of the constant stormy weather of this part of the world. The lai-ge island of Tierra del Fuego, or Land of Fire, is one of the many wooded islands ofif southern South America. Around the island is a rim of mountains, some of which send glaciers down to the sea. The interior is covered with a rich vegetation and the mountain slopes are well wooded with beech and other trees. Wild fruits abound in season, and many large flocks of sheep gi-aze on the rich pastures. The countries of Colombia and Ecuador at the north are lands of mountains aud high plains. The Andes i-un throuffh Colombia in three high chains enclosing two of the most fertile river valleys in all South America. In Colombia one will see planta-tions of sugar-cane, coffee, and cocoa; lianaua fields and large orange orchards. The cacao tree, from the .seeds of which chocolate and cocoa foi- eating and drinking are procured, gi'ows best in hot uuuutries. Cacao trees ai-e grown from fresh seeds planted In rows about five yards apart. The trees, which often reach a height of thirty feet, begin to bear in the sixth year and reach full fruit-bearing about the tenth year. The pod yielding the .seeds is of a golden color and contains from twenty to thirty- five seeds. In 1881, de Lesseps, a Frenchman, or-ganized a company to cut a canal across the Isthmus of Panama. This company failed, and the new company which was formed sold its rights to the United States, which will complete the canal in a few years. When this gi-eat work is opened, steamers from the United States, CutojHixi, one of the moat famoM jieakf of the Anden. Canada, and Europe to North American ports on the Pacific will no longer have to sail around the Horn, an extra journey of some 9,000 miles. Such a canal will be to the Americas what the Suez Canal is to the Old World. Ecuador is the most tropical part of westei-n South America. Along the sea- coast fine cocoa (the finest in the world), coffee, aud sugar are grown. On the pla-teau the volcano of Cotopaxi may be seen, and to the north of this, Quito, the highest capital-city in the world. This is a city of perpetual spring. One of the most important industries of Ecuador is the making of Panama",

The land may be thought of as lying in three great stretches, all sloping northwai-d toward the Arctic Ocean. The most north-erly region lies along the coast. This is a bleak and desolate land during most of the year. There are no trees, but the country is suitable to sucii animals as the reindeer, polar bear, and the fox. How long is a summer's day at tliis point ? South of the tundras is the forest belt, alieady described. The third belt boj-ders Ciiina and contains the best of the aniblc land of Siberia.

Western Asia. The countries of western Asia are tiie Turkisli Em[)ire in Asia, Vrabia, Persia, and Afghanistan, all coun-tries of very interesting pasts, but now of veiy little account. The larger portion of A.siatic Turkey is a high plateau, with so little rainfall that grazing is now the only }..r()fitable occnimtiou, though there arc regioiis well adapted to fniits and grains. I'j the lower valley of the Euphrates-Tigris, ancient Babylon, one of the marvels of the world, flourished. But the country is now little better than a fever-breeding swamp. Find Bagdad. Much of the land of Palestine, a small region along the ea.stern end of the Mediterranean, is now a bairen waste, brought al)out in part by the removal of the protecting forests. The most inter-esting place in this region is Jerusalem, now connected l)y railway with Jaffa. The interest of Palestine as a whole, lies in the fact that it was the scene of the life of Christ, and later the battle-ground of the wars of the Cnxsades. The interioi- of Aiabia is largely a grazing country in-habited l)y a shepherd class of peoj.le. Hedged in by the sea (m three sides and checked on the remaining side by a path-less tlesert, Ai-abia had to turn hu-gely to the sea as an outlet. This is one reason why Ai-ab traders have spread over Afi-ica so much. Arabia is the home of the fleet Arabian horse, the Arab camel, and the Arab donkey; and the south - wes^t corner produces the famous Mocha coflfee. Mecca, the chief town, has long been important because it is the birthplace of Mohammed and the holy city of his religious foUowei-s. At the south-west corner is Aden, a British station, so placed as to guard India and the Ked Sea. Aden is a coaling station for our fleet. Why is this needed ? It is also well fortified. Why ? The water supply of the city co?nes entirely from the occasional heavy rains, when rain-water is collected and stored up in great tanks. Aden came into our pos-session in 1S37 beeau.se of the treatment of a British ship's passengers by the Arabs when the ship was wrecked on their coast. thowK the",

The fii'st trouble came from the French who were established south of Fort St. George, and who thought by making a dash at the fort and taking all captive, to break up British trade in India. But this raid tunied out otherwise, for ir gave Robert Clive, a young clerk in the British service, a chance to make a name for him-self by first overcoming the French and afterwards l»y commencing a series of coiKjuests which led to the foundation of the present Indian Empire under King (ieorge V. India at this time had no one powerful enough to keep the country for the native- lK)rn.

At this battle Clive had only a thousand p]uropeans aial 'J,(M)() Hepoys, or natives in tlie employ of the British. The Nabob, or ruler of Bengal, had fifty thousand foot and eighteen thousand horse.

Years afterward it was destroyed l.y the Mofjids, who built a new city on the ruins of the former. The pre.sent Delhi was built hy Shah Jehan some three hundred years aifo. It stand- on the njifht hank of the .hunna Kiver, and occupies a locky hill overlooking the river. Within its high, nnissive walls are many beautiful liuildings. Among the j.rincipal are the palace of Shah Jehan and the equally fin«' .lumna mosque, whose marijle domes and minarets maybe seen towering above the city miles away. Delhi is now jin important manufacturing and ti.iding een- ti-e, and lines of railway connect it with idl parts of India. It wa.s at Delhi in l)ecend)er, 1911, that King George the Fifth was prochiimed Emperor of India at a most brilliant corona-tion Durbar. Words cannot describe the scene jtresenteil, when thousands of troops, native and British, the royal party, and the princes of India moved in a mighty pro- ces.sion to the music of massed bands and the roar of artillery. At this Durbar King George uttered the words that have trans- fen-ed the seat of govei-nmeut from the old capital, Calcutta, to the more imjiosiug and more historic capital, Delhi. Calcutta, till' former ciij.ital of India, is situated on a brandi of the (binges called the Uoogly. Where is Madi'as situated ?

South-eastern Asia consists of several countries, the one of chief interest to us being Hurma. a Mritish possession. Cpper BiU'ma is almost an unknown region. The foi'csts abound in wild animals. Crocodiles and poisonous snakes inhabit the swamps. The .south-flowing rivers flood the country at times, so that the j)eoi\u003ele have to build their homes on piles. Railways in India have been built to develop trade, to permit of a rapid move-ment of the troops, and to enable grain and othei- food products to be hurried to the starving peasants dui-ing times of famine. The principal lines run east and west across the northern plains and across the tableland of the Deccan. Lower Buiira was first ac(iuii-e\u003cl by Britain, and Upper Burma came into our possession a short time ago when Theebaw, a young king, commenced to celebrate his accession • the throne b\\- a massacre of his peop], Some of his subjects fled to southern iiarma, where they asked for British protection. This was granted, and Upj)er Burma became a British posses-sion. Mandalay is the capital of Upper Burma. The southern end of the Malay peninsula and the neighboring islands contain several small native .states and British .settlements.

The boundary of China, as it existed 2,000 years ago, is marked in part by the Great Wall. This wall is still in fair shape and is an object of very gi-eat interest to travellers. Find out why it was built, how many people were employed, and how long it took to build it. The jrreat plains of China are situatetl in the east, along the lowei- Hoang-ho and Yangtse-kiang. The largest is the Hoang-ho or Great Plain. The in- tei-ior is largely hilly or mountainous. The land is all for the people and is held by families on the pajnuent of a yearly tax. Agiicultuj-o is held in the greatest esteem, the far-mer ranking next to the scholar, but the imple-ments of the fann are crude and the farms are very small. The land, how-ever, is tended with such caie and patience, and irrigation and fertilization are so well developed, that large quantities of rice, com, tea, silk, and cotton are raised. The roads ai-e jMJor and almost impas-sable, and men do the work of beasts of bm-den. Tibet and Mongolia are largely grazing countries.

The ports at which tiade is earned on are called \" Treaty ports. \" Tientsin-f u, for example, is the port of the capital, Peking. Hong-Kong, a most valuable British possession, is an island. In 1841 this island was occupied by a few fisher-men and pirates. It is now the largest trad-ing post on the Chinese coast. Here large quantities of British cottons are exchanged for tea, silk, and hemp. Canton is one of the largest cities in China, and one of the largest in the world.

This lake, which is on the southern edjye of the desert, is iai'ge or small act'Oi(lin\u003ej to the season of the year. Heavy rains eanse it to overflow. l)rj' weather reduees it materially.

South of the equator are Ascension and St. Helena, the latter being the place of banishment of Napoleon from IHl.\") to his death in 1821. Madagascar on the east coast is the third largest island in the world. Fossil bones of a bird that stood ten feet high and laid an egg a foot long have been found on this island. Was the R«m' in the story of Sinbad the Sailor a myth ? Vegetation. There is always plenty of rain at the iHjuator. There is also abundant heal. These two conditions ai'e favorable to foi'est growth. The tHjuatorial forest stret\u003c ' acro.ss the country alK)ut the coast of the(iui! of Guinea for twelve hundred miles, and is, next to that of the Amazon, the largest forest area in tln^ world. If you can imaginean area four times as large as Great liritain, crow\u003cIed witii giant trees live feet in diameter and 2(K) tV-et in height ; trees whose branches are so woveu together that the sun can scarcely shine through th\u003c' dense foliage ; where each titn- stH'ins to be lasli(\u003ed toothers )\u003ey creeiMMs and twineis rangitig in size from the thickness of a jtiece of twine to that of a gieat roiM\u003e ; if you can further imagine an undergrowth so dense that walking through it is almost impossible; if you can picture a spongy forest floor, a dim light, thousands of murnuu'ing insects and vaj)Ors rising from the ground, you may have some slight idea of what this forest is like. Then you raist think of the hundreds of great Streams winding this way and that, but always in the forest shade. Into this great ar»a imagine human iH'ings living in total ignorance of the big open world beyond Ihe forest edge, and you hav«' a more complete but still a very im- imrfeet notion of this awful vastness. In the African fori'st are to Im' found the banana, the nil)lH'r plant, the ebony tree yielding a l)iack hea^y timber most us;'ful for the handles of table knives, for walking sticks and for jiiano keys, mahogany valu-able in cabinet work, the cofTtH' plant, and the palm. To the native the banana is most imjtor- tant. He roasts it, makes flour from it, and uses the fibre for making various things about hiw hut. If he has a few bananti phmts h(* is comfortable. Without them he will likely starve. The rublM'r phmt of Afnca is different from that of South Ameri\u003c'i\u003c. The Afiican plant is a crtH'per whose stem is often several inches thick. These creeju'i-s plait themselves like twining snakes alK)ut the trunks of trei's, or hang in great nuisses from the mighty branches. Tlu\u003ere is a .sajnng that where the rul)}H'r vine is abundant, neither man nor biid will find a good home. The oil-jtalm is abundant in the forest along the Guinea shore. The pidp is boiled in water an\u003cl the oil skimmed off as it rises to the top. North and south of the forest area are th • park-like lands where trws and rankgra-sses grow. Beyond these are the steppe lands, or grassy plains somewhat like our own prairies. In the park lands the natives pursue a lK)or class of farming. As these regions are .subjtH't to what may be called the wet and the dry seusons, the natives either follow their flocks and herds from pasture to pasture, or remain in the one place and try to do a little farming.

AUSTRALIA Australia, the new world of the southern hemisphere, was probably first visited by the Portuguese and the Dutch. But the land remained unknown imtil about 1770, when Captain Cook, a famous British sailor, visited the eastern coast and reported the country suitable for settlement. A few years later, in 1 788, a nnmber of British coloni.sts landed and commenced the fii-st Australian settle-ment near what is now called the city of Sydney. New arrivals year after year soon made the settlement prosperous, until the Mother Country began to use fra--away Australia as a convict station. This was very hard to endure by the industrious settlers, but the most serious thing was that some of the worst of the convicts escaped from time to time and formed themselves into gangs of bushrangers, who became the terror of the whole settlement. Strange to say, the British Government did not see its way to put a stop to this until 1853. In the meantime, many of tbe original settlers and nearly all the new comers had gone south and north in quest of a safer and more agreeable situation. In this and in other ways the Australian settlements spread, and Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, and West Australia were added to New South Wales, the original settlement. Position and Coast Line. Australia, the South Land, lies between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. It is south of the equa-tor, and numerous islands lie like stepping stones between it and south-eastern Asia. In area it is the smallest continent. Find by using the scale on the map, the gi-eatest length and the greatest width of Australia. Australia is of a compact shape, the two indentations or bends in the coast preserv-ing rather than interfering with the regu-larity of the outline. What other conti-nents have a similar coast line ! Is the coast line gi-eat or small for the size of the continent ? The northern and western coasts are mostly low, sandy shoi-es with but few openings of value, aiid few rivers worth the mentioning. The coast along the Australian Bight forms an unbroken cliff from 400 to 600 feet high, whUe the eastern and south-eastern coasts are mainly bold and rocky, with some fine harbors and navigable",
         "rivers. A STUDY OF THE CONTINENTS The most wonderful coast feature is the Great Barrier Reef which extends from near Cape York, the end of the Yo.-k peninsula, some 1,500 miles to the south. This reef is foiTOed by the coral polyp and rises from the bed of the ocean to the surface of the water at from 20 to 150 miles from the coast. Between the mainland and the reef the feea is usually calm, even when storms are ragmg and breakers are dashing against the outside of the reef. The channel, however, is difSeult to navigate ou account of the sunken i-ocks, and ships using this passage must anchor at night. Opposite the mouths of the larger i-ivers there are gaps or breaks m the reef, the coi- il polyp being unable to live in water holdinj.' sediment. Surface. The continent of Australia is shaped like a flat pie-dish, vnth high laud on the edges, and a saucer-like depression m the interioi-. The highest land is to-ward the east, where the Great Dividing Range runs parallel to the coast for ni\u003cir« than 2,000 miles, or along its entire length.",
         "14 184 A 8TTTDY OF THE CONTINENTS In the south-east the range is continuou\", but farther north it appears as tho edge of a table-land, which giadually sinks in the west into plains of great exte? The coast ranges extending along the nc u and west borders are not well known. Climate.

Australia should be the warmest? Why? Has any part of Australia a very cold winter ? The temperature of the different parts of Australia depends more on eleva-tion and distance from the sea than upon distance from the equator. In the neigh-borhood of the ocean there is no very great difference between tho temperature at mid-day and mid-night Inland these differ-ences are often considerable. As Australia is situated in the southern hemisphere its seasons are in every r^-^pect the reverse of ours. The noon-day sun is seen in the north, the south wind is the cold wind, and mid-winter comes in the month of June. What is the name of the dotted line running east and west across the centre of Australia? What doe6 this line mean 1 How much of Australia is in tho Heat Belt? Is the climate of southern Australia warmer or colder than ours ? Northern Australia, oeing between the tropics, is of course very hot. The rest of the continent is in the temperate region; hence, the heat diminishes towards the south. One of the most striking features of the Australian climate is the amount of sunshine. fiJeldom is the sky covered with clouds for a lonj^ time. The climate on the whole is very healthy, but its great drawl^acks are the long periods of dry weather, and the dry, hot, dust-laden winds, called \" brick-dustei-s,\" which some-times blow from the interior during the summer. When these winds are blowing the streets are deserted, all windows and doors are fastened, and yet the dust gets everywhere. The \"brick-dusters\" wither the pastures and play havoc generally with vegetation. The princii)al winds come from the east and the south-east, and are laden with clouds from the Pacific. As these winds ascend the eastern slope of the Divid-ing Range, the mountains rob them of their moisiure and as a result the eastern country has numerous rivers and rich pasture and fai-m lands. Beyond the highlands, the winds continue their course across the coniiuent, but as they bring little or no rain the interior becomes more and more desert-like, till at last it is nothing but one vast expanse of sandy, stony desert, covered here and theie with spinifex and other prickly plants. Western Australia is watered by moisture - bearing winds from the Indian Ocean. What parts of Australia have the greatest rainfall, and why 1 If the highlands were in the centre of the continent what difference would it make to the rain-fall ] If they were along the western instead of the eastern coast what difference would there be?

There are numerous lakes towards the south, but nearly all of them are salt and little better than shallow, reedy swampsor salt marshes during the dry season. On their surface *here is not a single boat, and on then- shores not even a small village. The only long rivers are the Murray and Its tributary, the Darling, which receive aU the inland streams of the south-east. 1 hough both streams have long courses and numerous tributaries, they cannot be \u003c-alled large rivers. They are not broad, neither are they deep except when swollen by rain^ In Its lower course the Mui-ray is quite a swift stream, with muddy banks widening near the sea into a lake too shallow for navigation. On portions of the Murray, flat-bottomed boats ply backwards and for-wards. The length of the Murrav is some-thing more than 2,000 miles. The Dui-liug IS often nothing but a series of pools in the summer season. The rivers on the eastern slope are numerous and rapid. Why should you expect this? Near their source the scenery is often very fine. There are no nvers flowing into the western half of the Austi-alian Bight. Why not f Plant and Animal Life. We have in Aus-tralia a dry interior where only plants of a desert character can grow, a belt of grass lands where there is a moderate lainlall, and a belt of forest wherever the rainfall is verj' abundant. The scrub lands, that is, the lands covered with vegetation of a st.intc? character, are mostly in the interior, though in parts of the far interior there is no vegetation worthy of mention. As a means of avoiding the loss ot moisture, some plants turn the edges ot their leaves toward the sun; others have thick, leathery leaves, and othei-s secrete oil borne imes the roots have to go very deep into the ground to obtain moist- re enough In many regions all the moisture comes from the heavy dew. Two plants may be mentioned here, namely, the mulga scnib and the spmifex. The mulga scrub is com-posed ot tlujrny a acias covered with short 'harp spines which tear both the clothes and the flesh of all who try to cross the region where they gi-ow. Spinifex is the dreaded i)orcupine gi-ass whose l.-avcs re-semble a thousand knitting needles stuck into a large pin-cushion. No horse can enter a spm.fex-covered area without woundine his legs and feet, and often these animals have to be killed to put them out of suffering The grass lands are found on the plains some di8tan..e from the eastern coast. Nearer the coast the country is covered with open, park-like lands gi-adually passing into the open grass lands. On these areas the kanga.00 grass and the salt bush, two very excellent pasturing plants, are found. The grass lands of Australia range from yctona to the Darting Downs. Western Australia has also similar lands. The chief points to be remembered alK)ut he forest life of this continent are, first, that most of the forest trees are evergreens' and secondly, that they do not, as a rule' grow massed together like the trees in our forests, but in small clumps, the g.-ound be-tween one dump and another being covered with a dense undergrowth, through which It 1^ a difficult matter to make one's way The forest regions lie near the coast where there is abundant moisture The northern forests are tropical, the bamboo and the palm prevailing. In the eastern and south-eastern forests various species of eucalyptus, or g-jm trees are found. One species of eucalyptus is a giant",

The kangaroo has short, weak front legs, and .-strong hind legs, that it never runs on all fours, but hops about on its hind legs, using The kangaroo. its powerful tail to help it to spring. It is hunted with specially bred dogs and pro-vides royal sport for the hunter As a result the kangaroo has disappear(;d from the more thickly settled parts of the country. What parts are these ? The dingo is the wild dog of Australia. It is as cunning as a fox, and kills sheep whenever it gets a chance. Because of this the dingo has a price on its head, and is hunted much as wolves are hunted in some parts of Canada. The largest bird of Australia is the emu, or Australian ostrich, a large, dvk'brown bird having wings so small that they are useless for flight. The - are much like hair and are valueless les. The e.uu feeds on the plains an(' hunted by the people with almost as great a delight as in the cose of the kangaroo. Can you see why it would be a gooil thing for Australia t«) get rid of the three animals mentione\u003cl T Along the channels of streams u very sti-ange animal may be seen. This is the duck-bill. The duck-bill has thick soft fur instead of feathers, a bill like a duck's aud webl)e«l feet with claws for swimming and foi- bunow.ng. It lays eggs like a bird, hatches them, and then suckles its young. In West Atistralia there are black swans. In north-eastern AustrtUia there are thou-sands of beautiful plumaged parrots, and bush turkeys whit h lay their eggs in a great heap of rubbish and leave the heat of the fennenting pile to do the hatching. The satin bower-bird builds a sort of playhouse near the tree where its nest is. The lyre-bird has a tail shaped like a lyi-e. English birds, sparrows, larks, thrushes, an'' ^ther singens have been introduced, though Australia is not without songsters peculiar to itself. As to Australian reptiles and fish. It may be said that there are alligators in the ri '^ers of northeiTi Australia sharics off the west-ern coast, and snakes are so common that the schools give instruction as to the best treatment \u003c\u003ef snake bite. There are many kinds of edible sea fish in the Australian waters. The salmon is lai-ge but has not the fine flavor of the northern fish. Among the curious fishes is the dugong, which eats gi-ass and grain though it lives in the water, and the frog fish that walks rather than swims.

Australia would ap-pear to have had little more than its healthy climate to recommend it as an ttbo\u003cle of man ; and yet, in a short period of tiiMe, British emigrants have made it a rich and prosjierouH «'ountry. The natives of Australia, at the time of its discovery by EuroiHjans, were among the nH)Mt miserable of people ; the «'ause of this lay largely in t.ie character of the small continent itself. Vegetation of a ftK)d-giving kind was scarce, and there were no animals that could be employed for domestic purjtoses; a poor country imleed for a savage people to make even a living in, a iK\u003eor laml to develop farmers and home makers. The \" black fellows,\" as the natives have been calle\u003ci, are dark-brown in color, with broad, squat noses, Mgh cheek bones, ugly mnuth.s, fine leeth, \u003c*urly black hair, and large beards. For food they eat anything they eau chew, and some of the wilder tribes are even said to devour liuraau beings. Their clothing is scanty, and their hoiises but pooi-ly constructed bark shelters. Their intelligence may be under-stood when we ai-e told that thev cannot count to five. At the snine time they l\u003eossess certain talents which have made them clever hunt* rs and tishermeu. Ho keen is their sight that they aie sometimett Ux-il as trackers of men. For weaiKins they use the sjwar, \u003c'lub, stone axe, and the IxH.inerang, the latter a curiously cut hard- wcmmI club uxed much as we use quoits. Hometimes these jK'ople can Iw |H'rsuaded to do a little herding, but «\u003en the whole they cannot Ih» truste\u003cl an«l they have often been a sour(!e of gi'eut annoyance to the settlers. In what way! So strong is their attach-ment to the wild life, that native children reare\u003cl by the settlers esca]\u003ee at the lirst opportunity to the bush. The Occupations of the People. In the desert there ore no jteople ami therefore no occupations. In the grass-lands the chief occui»ation is sheep-raising, which employs but few people to the s\u003cjuare mile, but which, nevertheless, retjuires energy and brains on the part of the worker. Why ! As a rule the sheep ranchei-s or squatters have fine horse.s, and live in comfoitable homes on their ranches. Their children, who jilay the ft -les that English-s]»eaking i)eople lov , are jiteii educateil by a private teacher. Fiom the cattle ranches great numbers of cattle are taken for shipment to Europe. How can a country where snow is seldom seen on the groimd, i)rovide the ice for the cold-storage of beef to Europe ! Your teacher will tell you of the great cold- storage plants on the Imats jtlying between Europe and Australia. If you have followed this account of the geography of Australia carefully, you will readily understand why the population is to be found near the coast and not in the interior. If you now bear in mind that Australia had not a single valuable animal, not a useful grain, and no fniits worth mentioning, you will appreciate move fully the agricultural labors that have reclaimed -",

Forests adorn the mountain slopes, and numerous lakes nestle in the valleys. The climate is superb. All the ft-uits of the Temj\u003eerate Belt gi-ow here in abundance. NEW ZEALAint This group of islands lies some 1,200 miles to the south-east of Australia and exactly opposite the British Islands on the other side of the globe. The map of tnese islands is something like that of Italy turned upside down. North Island is a hmd of vol-canoes and hot springs. Think of washing-day in this island. Think of using Ixuhng water of nature's own heating to cook Christmas puddings ! South Island has a range of timber- clad mountains aloMg the west. The liighest of these mountains are covered with peipetual snow, and glaciers and glacial lakes and streams aboun^l. The climate is tempei-ate, moist and healthy. The kauri-pine, a fine timber tree, yields a gum used in making varnish. This gum is collecteil after the tree has lain on the gi\"ound sevei'al years. The curious birds of New Zealand are the kiwi or apteryx, a wingless, tail-less bird with a long, slender beak ; and the parson-bird, with his shining black coat and his white throat feathei-s. The natives, called Maoris, belong to the brown race. They spin, weave, and dye flax. They are also skilful fishermen. The settlers are mostly from Scotland. Sheep- farming is tiie greatest industiy; the sheep being reared principally for their mutton, which is sent in great quantities to Eng-land.

         "202 PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT The provinces of Manitoba, Saakatchewan, and Alberta, on account of the surface aspect of their best known s, are commonly grouped together under the name \" Prairie Provinces,\" the term \" pr lirie province \" being first applied to Manitoba alone. With the progress of settle-ment and the establishment of a common form of political organization over two more recently established provinces, the term has been widened in significance to stand for the area included in Manitoba and in the two provinces between it and the Rocky Mountains. MA NITOBA . SA SKA TCHEWA N, AND ALBERT A THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES On May 2nd, 1670. Charles ll., king of England, granted a charter to the Hudson's Bay Company by which the ownership of Rupert's Und, as the vast centra] area of Canada was then called, became vested in this company. It controlled all the trade, regulated all the afl.tirs, and became its sovereign rulers under the authority of the monarchs of England. On November 19, 1869. the Company surren-dered its rights in the North-West lands to the British Crown, and on June 22, 1870, the surren-der was formally accepted. The North-West Territory at this time was practically the Mac-kenzie basin, while Rupert's Land included the rest of Western Canada north of the international boundary, as far west as the Rocky Mountains, east to include parts of northern Ontario and Quebec and nonh to the Arctic Ocean. On the Dominion Government .satisfying the claims of the Hud.son's Bay Company, this territory oecame part of Canada on July 15th, 1870. The name \"North-West Territories\" was applied to the whole of the newly-acquired country. As soon as practical, after its -\"^-luisition, the central government at Otta- , the sub-division of this vast area i. .vinces and territories and formed local gv^verning bodies similar to those already established in the older parts of the Dominion. The creation of the province of Manitoba in the year 1870 was an important event in the history of Western Panada, as it meant the exercise of effective sovereignty with respect to the West as well as the establishment of local self-Kovemment . The western boundary of the province was the meridian of 99 , which waa extended to just beyouil the meridian of 100 in 1877, but the total area in either case w-.s only a fraction of the present area of the province. The present boundaries were fixed in 1912. The name of North-West Teiritories has been used at all times to designate the parts cHVestem Canadaoutside of the organized provinces. The organization of this territory has gone on gradu-ally to answer different needs and demands. In 1876 Keewatin District was formed, and made tributary, politically, to Manitoba. In the .same year a Lieutenant-Governor and Council were given to the rest of the Territories which had been tributary to Manitoba up to this time. In 1882 four districts— Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska— were marked -juc from this area for postal districts. Electoral divisions were carved out of this territory between 1875 and 1877 to the number of fourteen, and the members for these were added to the council. In 1888 an assembly wholly of elected members, which by 1900 had acquired practically all the iwwers of provincial governments, took the place of the council. In 1905 the two provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta were formed out of the area approximately contained in the four provisional districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska. Geology. The plains ot Western Canada lie in a wide trough between two elevated masses of rock, the Laurentian Plateau .^nd the Rocky Mountains.

On the western slope of this axis, lonjf oefore the upheaval of the Rtwky Mountains, the many beds of sr Jimentary rocks that at prewnt -mder- lie the prairies were formed. In the Re\u003cl River Val! • these rocks are for the most part from 40 t feet below the surface. At one or two points oufroppinKs of limestone are fotmd, with only n few feet of earth on top. From these, buildinjf stone is (piarried in larjfe quantities. The elevation of the Rockr Mountain chain was the last K'reat upheaval that took place in our continent. It followed lonjf after the sedi-mentary rocks n erretl to had been formed. Subsequently occurred the many chantfes that have given rise to the present configuration of the plains. These changes were mainly brought about durin;^ the glacial period, when the clays, silts, sands and gravels were brought down from the hig r levels and distributed over the ' djacent low imls. Th^.se \"drift\" deposits are spread more uniformly over the first and second prairie steppes than they are over the third. The r'ch black loam which covers the under-lying drift over such extensive areas is of com-paratively rece- t origin. It is formed largely from the accumulation of decayed trees, grasses, and other plants. Unde'-lying the third prairie steppe are ex-tensive coal-beds. They are very valuable as a source of suppl\\ for fuel. In the valleys of most of the streams issuUi^r from the Rocky Mountairs, beds of sandstone are seen wherever the i.vers have cut their channels deep enough. Most of this sandstone is easily worked and is used extensively for building purposes. Fine gold is also found in the beds of most of these sy-eams. It was thought at one time that the source of the gold was in the mountains, but it is now generally agreed that it exiita in the gravels that were distributed over the western plains during the glacial ciMK'h. PoaitioB and EzMat. The provinces of Mani- tobit, .Saskatchewan, and Alberta occupy the greater part of the Great Central Plain lying within the Dominion of Canada and stretching from the international boundary to the Arctic Ocean, and in width varying from 800 milea in the south to 300 miles in the north. The province*, lie »x:tween the Rocky Mountains and the Laurentian Plateau, but the latter highland intrudes oii the north-eastern parts of all three provinces. These provinces are bounded on the north by the North- West Territories on the south by the United States, on the east by the provii, e of Ontario and a small part of the United States, and on the west by British Columbia. The greatest length from north to south is 750 miles, and from oast to west about 1,000 miles. They comprise a total area of 756,000 square miles. Surface. The term \"prairie provinces' ' which is commonly applied to the group made up of Manito'\u003ea, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, is appli-cable only to the part of the group lying along the southern boundary. Four different surface aspects in relation to the presence or absence of timber occur within the provinces. The southern part of the pro-vinces is prairie, which shades into a mixed timber or scrub and prairie country in the cent, sometimes called the i)ark country. The northern part of the area of the three prairie provinces is generally well timbered except in the extreme north, where timber growth lightens toward the limits of the temperate zone. The most imjjortant structural features of the area taken up by the provinces are displayed in the orairie .irea. The country south of the North Saskatchewan is naturally divided into three distinct levels, called the three prairie steppts, and ct^nforming generally to the areas occupied by the three provinces. These steppes differ in elevation and surface features. The first steppe is represented in the province of Manitoba, and consists mainly of the Red Rivcf Valley. The surface is generally level",

The height of land however, lies north of the international boundan^ for the greater part of the way in Albena and Saskatchewan, and a small part of the drainage is directed into the Mississippi. On the other hand, the Red River flows north from the Ln.ted States. The chief rivers of the northern system are the Athabaska and Peace and their PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT 8 Tibntaries.

In the south-«estern part of the area extending across southern Alberta for some distance into Sa.skatchewan. the availiible or effective rainfall is somewhat reduced by the influence of the Chinook. On the other hand the same influence is accountable for moderat-ing practically the climate of the whole of the province of Alberta, .so as to change materially us extreme character, and to open up possibili-ties for northern development which, up to the present, have not been fully or adequately taken account of. Its influence extends for a consider-able distance into southern Saskatchewan, and necessanlytheunobstructedsurfaceof the prairie intenor makes perceptible, even into Manitoba the atmospheric changes which occur in the other provinces. The importance of the Chinook .11 relation to the western part of the interior --s such, and its effect is so much in the nature ot an exception, that it demands",
         "explanation PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT \\m Tlie term Chinook was first applied to a moist w 1 blowing: along the ocean over Astoria, in Oregon, from the direction of the camping-place of the Chinook Indians, near the mouth of the Columbia River. The term has since been extended, and its significance changed to stand for a much more important and larger influence. It is now applied charac-teristically to warm, dry winds descending east of the Cascade Range in Washington, and of the main range of the Rockies in Montana and Alberta. It was supposed to owe its existence and character to the warm Japan current, and this is still a common belief ; but this current is small and is 1,000 miles from the coast, and need not be assumed to account for even the warmth of the moist coast Chinook, as against the moderating influence of the great body of the Pacific. The warmth of the dry Chinook is due to a wholly different cause. It is due chiefly to the compression of air descending from the moun-tain, the moisture from which has been ab-stracted on the western slope of the Rockies. Its peculiarity is that it blows from the mountains and plateaus where ice and snow persist, and occurs on the prairies as a dry, hot wind. It has no relation to the warming effect of the sun, as it arrives as frequently in the dead of night as in the daytime. The beginning point for the prairie Chinook is a high pressure area in the Rocky Mountain plateau, as that over Utah or southern Idaho. This area customarily moves north from Cali-fornia and dissipates northerly, giving rise to a Chinook between the Cascades and Rockies northerly or north-westerly, as well as a north-easterly wind which climbs the main range of the Rockies. The movement of air up the mountains from the base of the anti-cyclonic column leads to its expansion from decreasing pressure as higher altitudes are reached. This expansion u.ses up heat. The capacity of air to retain moisture decreases as its temperature is lowered, so that condensation of its vapour occurs as the air reaches higher altitudes. Condensation of vapour renders sensible the latent heat used in previous evaporation, so that the lowering of temperature goes on at a rate below normal. The descent of the cun-ent on the east side of the Rockies means a heighten-ing of temperature from pressure of the upper volume of air. It is estimated that the increase is half a degree for every three hundred feet of descent. As the height of the mountains is from 5,000 to 8,000 feet, this means considerable direct gain. The warmth of the prairie Chinook will then be seen to be due to two causes : the evolving of latent heat by condensation of mois-ture on the western slope of the Rockies, and an increase of temperature due to compression on the eastern side. The effects of the Chinook are startling. It introduces April weather into midwinter, and may remove a foot of snow in a few hours. It makes possible the running of stock out of doors the year round . The visits of the Chinook lessen the danger of spring floods, by carrying off precipitation in instalments. The sudden changes in temperature do not seem to induce sickness and disorder, though changes of from 20 to 40 degrees in tempe'-ature may occur in fifteen minutes. On the other hand, it has given to localities over which it blows the name of being semi -arid. Though these areas have precipita-tion about equal to that in other parts of the province, the evaporation of rain and snow by the Chinook has reduced available moisture, or has made necessary the employment of special methods of soil culture to receive and retain moisture. Except for the Chinooks, which generally come with considerable velocity, the provinces are not subject to violent atmospheric disturbances. System of Survey. There are three systems of survey followed in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. These systems are essentially the same, differing only with respect to the number and width of the road allowances. The first system is the one under which the older part of Manitoba, that portion of Saskatchewan lying east of the Second Meridian and south of Township 31, and small areas in the vicinity of Prince Albert, Rosthem, and Kinistino, have been surveyed. The second system is restricted to Townships 1 and 2, Ranges 1 to 8 inclusive ; Townships 19 to ?.0. Ranges 1 to 12 inclusive ; and Townships 27",
         "to PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT 30 Ranges 13 to 16 inclusive. The third system IS the one uifdcr which the greater part of the land in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the northern part of Manitoba has been laiti \u003c,tit. Under the first and second sjsiems of survey, a road allowance of one and one-half chains, or 99 feet in width, was provided around each section In the third system, road allowances one chain in width were allowed on every section line runnine north and south, and on every alternate section line running east and west, that is. along the north and south boundaries of the township, and along the second and fourth section lines north of the south boundary of the township. In all the systems, the land is uniformly laid out in quadrilateral townships about six miles square, and containing thirty-six sections each one mile square, together with certain allowances for roads, as in the accompanyin.s,- \u003c]iad the position of thero^5 anowLrnVt^i,,-!'''

In commencing the survey, the international boundary line was fixed upon as the starting point, and was called the first ba.se line. From It other lines, called initial meridians, were run due north. The first initial meridian, called the Principal Meridian, passes about eleven miles west of the town of Emerson, in Manitoba. The Second Meridian corresponds with longitude 102 the Third Meridian with longitude 106, and so on, each initial meridian after the second being four degrees west of the preceding one. For convenience in surveying, the land is first aid out into blocks. This is done bv surveying lines parallel to the first base line, and twenty- four miles, or the width of four townships, apart These are also called baselines, and are num-bered in regular order northward as far as the survey extends. These lines form the northern and southern boundaries of the blocks The eastern and western boundaries are formed by surveying meridians north and south from the base lines to the depth of two townships. Owing to the curvature of the earth's surface, these meridians approach each other as they extend northward, and diverge as they extend south-ward ; and as the blocks have been laid out of a uniform width of twenty-four miles, these meridians will not meet, thus giving rise to what is commonly known as a \" jog \" The lines along which this jog is laid off. and which are midway between and parallel to the base lines, are known as \" correction lines.\" They too, are numbered in regular order as they extend northward, the first correction line being twelve miles north of the first base line the second one twelve miles north of the second base line, and so on. Each block is then surveyed into sixteen townships, and each township is further sub-divided, as indicated above. In subdividing the blocks, the townships are laid out of the exact width of SIX miles along the base lines, exclusive of road allowances. The eastern and western boundaries are then run due north and .south till the correction lines are reached. The townships are numbered in regular order from the 49th parallel, or first base line north-ward. The first tier of townships adjoining this base line on the north is called Township I,",
         "the 6 PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT second tier north Township II, the third tier north Township III, and so on as far as the survey extends. These townships lie in rows or \"ranjres,\" and are numbered in regrular order east and west from the Principal Meridian, and west from the other initial meridians. Thus the first row of townships adjoining the Principal Meridian on the east is said to be in Range I, the second row is said to be in Range II, etc., east of the Principal Meridian. The first row of townships adjoining any initial meridian on the west is .said to be in Range I, the second row is said to be in Range II, etc., west of the Principal, First, Second, etc., Meridian, as the case may be. This numbering is continued until the next initial meridian is reached. The numbering of sections in each township begins in the s \u003enth-east comer. The ..-uth- east section is number 1, the one immediately west of it is number 2. The second row of sections begins with number 7, immediately above number 6, and the third with number 13, above 12, etc. In all townships subdivided as above, Sections 11 and 29 arc set apart for school purposes ; Sec-tion 8 and three-quarters of Section 26 belong to the Hud.son's Bay Company. In every fifth township the Hudson's Bay Company has in addition the other quarter of Section 26. Of the remaining sections, those bearing even numbers have been reserved by the Dominion Government for homestead entry, while of those bearing odd numbers a large number belong to the Canadian Pacific and to other railway companies. An exception to the sys'em mentioned above was made in the case i . certain settlements along the Saskatchewan and Red and other rivers in the different provinces in which the land was laid out in long, narrow strips fronting the rivers. The.se strips of land are called \" river lots.\" Transportation. The prairie provinces are served by three great systems of railway lines, the Canadian Pacific, Canadian Northern, and Grand Trunk Pacific. The main line of the Canadian Pacific, which was completed in 1885, is the only tran.scontinental line yet completed. It runs through the southern part of Manitoba and Saskatchewan at a distance of from sixty to one hundred miles north of the international boundary, turns north-west in Alberta, and leaves the province by the Kicking Horse Pass, about one hundred and seventy-five miles north of the southern boundary of the province. Its important branch lines are the Crowsnest Pass Railway, the Macleod, Calgary, and Edmonton branch, a line connecting Portage la Prairie and Wetaskiwin by way of Saskatoon, and another connecting Moosejaw and Lacombe. A branch running from Moosejaw south-east through Portal, is jiart of the Soo line, an alternate route to the east by St. Paul. Besides these, the system has a great number of branch lines in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The Canadian Northern enters the prairie country near the south-east corner of Manitoba, and runs in a general north-westerly direction through Winnipeg and Battleford to Edmonton. From here its route is directly w to the Yellowhead Pass, from which point .vill run south-west and reach the coast at Vancouver. It has also a number of important branch lines ; one through north-western Manitoba runs north of the main line to Prince Albert, another con-nects Prince Albert, Saskatoon, and Regina, and a third connects Regina with Winnipeg. A branch rtinning directly north connects Edmonton and Athabaska Landing. It has branches from Saskatoon and Vegreville to Calgary. It also has branches running south into the United States. Controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company has a small system between Leth- bridge and Coutts connecting with the Great Northern system, and a branch line from Stirling to Cardston. The Grand Trunk Pacific runs north- wresterly from Winnipeg to Edmonton. Its route is then west to the Yellowhead Pass and north-westerly to Prince Rupert, on the Pacific Coast. It has a branch from Regina north-east to Melville, one from Tofield to Calgary completed, and a number of other branches projected. Before the advent of railways considerable traffic was carried on by flat-bottomed boats and canoes in the North Saskatchewan",
         "and PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT other rivers of the province. At present steamers ply east and west of Prince Albert and on Lake Winnipeg:. Improvements at the foot of Lake Winnipeg and at the rapids below Prince Albert will give a water route between Edmonton and Wmmpeg. Steamers ply on the Athabaska and Peace Rivers, and on Lesser Slave Lake. POPULATION The Indians. The aboriginal inhabitants of Western Canada were the Indians. They were practically in undisturbed occupation of many parts of the western provinces within the memory of living men, and are still seen in all the pro-vinces unmixed with civilized new-comers. In all the provinces, likewise, there has been con-siderable intermarrying of the white and red races, and half-breeds are common throughout the three provinces. The great Algonquin nation, with its Crees. Ojibwas, and Blackfeet, stretched from Labra-dor, past Hudson Bay, to the Rocky Mountains. The Swamp Crees were between Lake Winnipeg and Hudson Bay, the Wood Crees along the . North Saskatchewan, and the Plain Crees in Southern Saskatchewan, while the Blackfeet were in Southern Alberta. The Ojibwas were on the present western boundary of Manitoba and around the Qu'Appelle. The Assiniboines were along the inner slope of the Rock:( \u003e-: To the north the great Athabaska nation .,pread from Hudson Bay to Alaska and up to the Eskimo country. A remnant of them, the Sarcees, were as far south as Calgary. A small settlement of Iroquois were near Edmonton, and a larger number around the headwaters of the Athabaska, having been brought out origin-ally by the North-West Fur Company. Their distribution has remained about the same, but they are now confined to reserves allotted by the Dominion Government. An attempt is being made to teach them the arts of the white men. Some progress is possible on the industrial side. Ranching and a little cultivation are practised. All efforts at liberal culture appear to be wasted on them. They cannot be assimilated to the white man's civiliza-tion on the intellectual and social sides ; and not only this, the cramp of settlement is fatal to them. They are becoming fewer in numbers annually. The total Indian population of the three prairie provinces is only 24,141. White Population. The greater part of the present population of the prairie provinces is British or Canadian. Though the population IS quite cosmopolitan with respect to the number of peoples represented, British and Canadian people predominate in seven eighths of the settled area of the country. The order in which the British people stand as to numbers is English, Scotch, and Irish in the order named. Next to British and British-Canadian come French, fol-lowed by Germans, Scandinavians, and Aus- trians. A considerable section of recent additions to population consists of reixttriated Canadians from the United States. The .social and political ideals of the western provinces are distinctly and essentially those belonging to people who have been bred under the British flag. The foreign population of Western Canada is made up of industrious and law-abiding people. The vigour of school administration in the different provinces . is rapidly moulding them to Canadian ideals. The establishment of white settlement and white domination of the vast interior of Canada followed different lines and directions from those which have been more recently followed with the introduction of a transcontinental railway. From the nucleus of the Selkirk colony in Manitoba, the general route of exploration and serious settlement was along the North Saskatchewan Valley, by way of the Touchwood Hills, to Battleford and Edmonton. These three points stand for early development in settlement and cultivation. The advent of the Canadian Pacific Railway swung settlement along the southern part of the prairie. Latterly, with the build-ing of the Grand Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern, a new area for settlement has been opened up, and settlement is spreading rapidly northward. The proposed Hudson Bay route still farther north will open not only new an as for settlement and cultivation, but will develop the forest, lake, and mineral resources of all the provinces, and inaugurate a new era in transportation by shortening the route to Liver-pool, as well as reducing the cost by shorter rail and relatively longer water",

The government of the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatche^van, and Alberta con-sists of a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Dominion Government, an executive council representing: the party having: a majority in *he legrislature, and j.n elected Legislative Assembly. MANITOBA Position. The Province of Manitoba is situated along the southern boundary of the Dominion, about midway between the east and west coasts. It is the most easterly of the three prairie pro- \\ ■ ccs. It is bounded on the north by the 60th parallel ; on the south by the United States ; on the east by the Province of Ontario, and a small part of the United States, including- a part of the Lake of the Woods ; and on the west by the Province of Saskatchewan. The 60th parallel forms the northern boundarj-, and the 49th the southern. Area. Its area is 251,832 square miles. Surface. Approximately, half of the province of Manitoba consists of land in the area of the first prairie steppe, which runs north-westerly through the province. On the east side the Laurentian Plateau falls within the province to the extent of about a fifth of the total area of the province. The second prairie steppe, whose eastern boundary runs from the north-west cor-ner of Manitoba to a point east of the middle of the south boundary, covers fully a fourth of the area of the province on the west and south-west. The middle area gives the province its charac-teristic feature, being generally rich level prairie land of great depth and fertility. The elevation of Lake AV'innipeg is 700 feet above the level of the sea, and the average elevation of the whole of the first prairie steppe is only 800 feet. It is in this area that almost the whole of the water surface of the province occurs, which is about one seventh of the total area of the province. The boundary between the first and second prairie steppes is marked by a series of eleva-tions which occur under the names of Pembina Mountains, Riding Mountains, and Duck Moun-tains, in Manitoba, the Porcupine Hills on the boundary, and the Pasquia Hills in Saskat-chewan The Turtle Mountains lie in an • related group in the south-western part of the province. The Riding, Duck, and Turtle Mountains are held as timber reserves by the federal govern-ment. The part of Manitoba in the second prairie steppe is more rolling than the central portion, but the cc\"trast in surface between it and the surface of the first prairie steppe is not great. The Laurentian area, on the other hand, in the east and north-east of the province, is more abrupt in slope and more diversified in surface. It is rough, broken, rocky, and wooded with light timber. Some portions of •♦ are wet and boggy. The effect of the rivers in relation to surface features varies. In the second prairie steppe the Assiniboine, at the western boundary of Manitoba, flows in a channel from 250 to 300 feet deep, the sides of which are locally known as \" cutbanks,\" v.nile in the first prairie steppe the rivers frequently overflow their '^^nks. The rivers in this steppe are filled with j.Jiment in the bottom. The erosion is wholly lateral, and the rivers are generally very wide. In the Laurentian slope of the province the rivers have cut deep, rocky channels through their valleys. Tree growth is common on the banks of the rivers of the second prairie steppe, and to a less extent along the banks of the rivers of the first prairie steppe. The Laurentian plateau is generally wooded, though the timber, except in the north, is not heavy. South-eastern Manitoba is fairly well wooded. Drainage. The whole of the drainage of the province of Manitoba finds its way to Hudson Bay by the Nelson River. The great gathering- place of the rivers of the province is Lake Winnipeg, which receives its waters from slopes on the south, west, and east sides. The Red River is the largest and most important river of the province. It rises in the state of Minnesota, flows north for 700 miles, and empties into the most southerly extremity of Lake Winnipeg. It carries a vast amount of sediment, with which a large delta is being formed at the head of the lake, and which interferes with lake and river navigation. The western slope of the province is made tributary to the Red River basin by the entrance of the Assiniboine at Winniijcg. The Assiniboine rises in the pro-vince of Saskatchewan and flows",
         "south-easterly. PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT After crossing the Manuoba boundary it receives the gu'Appelle, also from Saskatchewan, at Fort ElHce. and finally flows east till it reaches the Red River. A second important tributary of the Assiniboine is the Souris. The Souris rises in the Missouri Coteau, flows east through the greater part of Saskatchewan, turns south into Dakota and, doublinff back, enters the Assiniboine east of Brandon. From the Riding Mountains a third tributary, the Little Saskat-chewan, is received. The Pembina is a tributary entering- the Red near the boundary. The western slope of the province to the north is represented in the Dauphin River, which drains Lakes Dauphin, Winnipegosis, and Manitoba into Lake Winnipeg through the Fairford River and Lake St. Martin. The chief river entering Lake Winnipeg on the east is Winnipeg River, which, with its tributaries the White- mouth and Bird, drain the south eastern por-tion of the province. The Winnipeg River has its source in the Lake of the Woods. Its course is rapid and is frequently broken by S/. Andrews Kapids and Bridgf, Red River. rapids and falls, which offer large possibilities for the development of power enterprises, one of which has already been inaugurated at Lac du Bonnet. Numerous small streams enter Lake Winnipeg farther north. As has been seen, the lakes of Manitoba are an integral part of ih'^ drainage sv-stem. Besides this, the lakes are interesting by reason of their being the centre of an ancient basin containing a much greater volume of water than the present lakes contain, and which has had an important influence on the economy and industry of ihe province. Lake Agassiz is the name applied to this body. It covered about three quarters of the present area of Manitoba, ani extended into Ontario and the United States, the western boundary being the lin^ of hills marking the eastern bt ; 'ary of the second prairie steppe. By reason of Lake Winnipeg being the centre of such a large sedimentary basin, it is extremely shallow in relation to its area. Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis are of the same character. These two bodies are of the same elevation, the current of the connecting stream, Ebb and Flow River, flowing north or south according to the direction of wind pressure on the surface of the lakes. The outlets to Dauphin and Swan lakes are the Mossy and Shoal rivers respectively both emptying into Lake Winnipegosis All the important lakes of the province are thus seen to be tributary to the great drainage reservoir of Lake Winnipeg. Lake Winnipeg Itself has a length of 250 miles, and varies in width from 25 to 60 miles. It is in no place more than 70 feet deep, and its channels must be carefully followed in navigation. The proximity of the large lakes to the centreof population of the prov-ince is important on account of the oppor- ?s they afford for rec. tion. They are attractive to the sports-man and to the summer visitor. Winnipeg Beach, Whytewold, and Ponemahare popu-lar summer resorts on Lake Winnipeg. Climate. The province of Manitoba, being situated at a long distance from the moderating influence of large bodies of water, and in the temperate zone, is subject to extremes of heat and cold. Summer heat frequently rising to 90 degrees, and winter cold as low as 40 degrees below zero, are not uncommon. The great evaporating basin of the lakes exercises a per-ceptible influence in the reduction of summer heat locally. The seasons are usually steady and well-defined. The snow lies without inter-ruption in winter, the spring is marked by liberal rainfall and very rapid growth, and the summers are warm and conducive to the full ripening of the characteristic cereal crops . The autumns are sharp and generally clear and highly enjoyable. The snow is dry and the air clear and bracing in winter. The precipitation is ade-quate to the growth of heavy crops throughout the province, being about twenty inches",

Manitoba stands in the first rank for the quality of its wheat among the different wheat-producintr countries of the world. Grain- growing is the chief industry of the province. The soil of the greater part of ihe province being the sediment of an ancient lake topped by centuries of decayed vegetation, is in most places extremely rich in the elements of plant food. The soil of the second prairie steppe is somewhat lighter than it is in the first steppe. The climate, as respects both the liberal moisture of June and the heat of liurvest time, is the other imp(jrtant condition to successful giain-growing. The long days of sunshine and the short nights have an important influence. Crops are likewi.se aided by the deep frosts of winter, which insure the gradual rise of moisture by capillarity and support the crops notwithstanding occasional interruptions of precipitation. The other grain crops grown are oats, barley, rye, and flax. All kinds of tame grasses .succeed, and mixed prairie hay of fine nutritive properties can be cut in abundance in both prairie and slough land. Fodder com is a successful crop. The system of agr' uUure is being rapidly modified by the substituting of mixed farming for grain-growing. Fodder crops are being more generally grown, and the returns from land increased and made more certain and stable by more complex and varied production. Mani-toba excels in the quality of its heavy horse stock and shorthorn cattle. The province raises a large number of cattle of export quality ; and dairying, hog, and sheep raising are becoming settled and important adjuncts to cultivation. In certain districts dairying has become a special industry. The chief agricultural exports are grain and cattle to the British market, and dairy products to the western provinces and the Yukon. An important development of the grain-grow-ing industry of the province is the trade in seed grain arising from the perfection and constitution of the northern grown grain. Vegetables, nxsts, and small fruits are other crops that succeed well, and tree fruits are being experimented with for the development of hardy varieties for general use in the province. Lumbering is carried on in the northern part of the province chiefly tributary to Lake Winni-peg. Selkirk, Winnipeg, and Brandon have saw-mills. The chief kinds of timber found in the province are spruce, poplar, jackpine, birch, and tamarac. The chief sawn timber of the province is spnice, which is useful for IcK-ai needs, but the indu.stry drjcs not meet the general needs of t!.e province for this class of building material, British Columbia furnishing a considerable part of the lumber reciuired. Fishiug. The fishing industry is of great im-portance and commercial value to the province. All the lakes, Winnii)eg, Manitoba, Winnipe- gosis, and Dauphin, abound witli a good class of *- *_ .:3 ff^ ^J^j^^^'^ \"■■WfPH MTtHOlY \"^ •• : -T. - ' ■ 1 p. ■^FrVrc ' \"^S '■' j^lil fish Hatchery at Selkirk. food-fishes, such as trout, whitefish, sturgeon, pickerel, perch, and pike, the most important and valuable being whitefish and sturgeon. The industry engages considerable capital in tugs, boats, freezers, and other equipment, and gives employment to a great many people. The greater part of the catch finds a market in the United States. The industry is under strict government supervision and regulation. Mining. Manitoba is not rich in minerals. Soft coal occurs in Turtle Mountain in the south-west but there is no actual mining. At Gypsum- ville, on Lake Manitoba, gypsum is found and treated. Salt is found adjacent to Lakes Mani-toba and Winnipegosis, and limestone is quarried at Stonewall and Stony Mountain. At Tyndall a fine quality of finishing stone is quarried, which has a large sale within and outside of",

Manufacturing is becoming' of considerable importance in Manitoba, chiefly in relation to the materials of the common resources of the province. Flour-mills are common everywhere, and all of them manufacture for exp\u003cjrt. Cereal foods of all kinds are manufactured and ex-ported. Lar«-e packing concerns are established in WinnijjeR. The making of bricks, drain tile, and other clay prtxhicts, is Injcominff a larj^^e industry. Lime-burnin«: is an important in-dustry. The manufacture of farm imjilements, wire fencing-, and throshins: machines is carried on in Winnipeg,' and Hrandon. Winnipeg Ix-injs' one of the great transportation points of the three transcontinental railways, the work (jf the shops gives employment to a large number of men. The manufacture of iron and steel struc-tural material is becoming very important. Leather manufactures, principally of harness and saddles, are important. They produce for a large western demand. Biscuits, pickled goods, and cigars are manufactured in Winni-peg, and gla.ss at Beausejour, east of Winnipeg. Transportation. Manitoba, in common with other prairie provinces, requires large trans-portation facilities to carry the immense weight and bulk of grain towards the great export points and to distribute wholesale commodities to the west. The greater part of the crop moves out to Fort William and Port Arthur for lake shipment while navigation is open. Three great companies, the Canadian Pacific, the Canadian Northern, and the Grand Trunk Pacific, have lines running through the province and connect-ing, or being about to connect, both coasts of the Dominion. The Canadian Pacific and Canadian Xorthem and Cireat Northern have routes to the south. All the great lines of rail-way are running lines north-west to serve the needs of distribution and production in the northern parts of Saskatchewan, and more particnlariy of Alberta. The province is a net-work of branches and cross lines. Navigation is not important, except on Lake Winnipeg ; and up the river as far as Winnipeg, the railways have taken the place of river trans-portation. It is certain, however, that water trans]. ortation, particuhirly on the Saskatche-wan, will be facilitated by improvements which will overcome the raiiids, and that a long water route from beyond Edmonton to Winnipeg will be developed. At present the railway companies are laying lines to secure territory, but the economy of water traffic will mean its later use. Closelv- connected with the transportation facilities of the province is the vast storage capacity represented in the elevator system. The chief terminal elevators are at Fort William and Port Arthur. In the province hundreds of the.se appear along tne lines of railway. CITIES irinnipeg, the cajiital, and the largest city cr the province, is situated at the junction of the Assinilx.ine with ihe Red River, ft was origi-nally a trading-i^ost and fort of the Hudso \"s Bay Company, anu was called Fort Garry. 1 its growth has occurred within the past twenty- five or thirty years. It is a striking example of the speed of development of a western civiliza-tion for which it characteristically stands. It is just at the entrance to the be.,t part of the great prairie provinces, and practically all the heavy traffic between Western and Eastern Canada passes through it. All distribution to the west- em provinces takes place from Winnipeg, or passes through it. It has three great lines of railway, the Canadian Pacific, Canadian Nor-thern, and Grand Trunk Pacific, running from coast to coast, passing through it, and the Great Northern from St. Paul enters Winnipeg. In addition to this, innumerable branch lines bring a large area of productive country directly tribu-tary to the city. It is the educational, political, commercial, financial, and railway centre of the province. It is the headquarters of the govern-ment telephone system, which has a vast net-work of lines in almost all the towns and villages as well as in the rural districts of the province. The University of ^lanitoba, St. John's, Mani-toba, and Wesley Colleges, the Agricultural College, Medical College. School of Pharmacy, the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, and Pro-vincial Normal School, comprise the educational institutions of provincial importance. The edu-cational ser\\'ices of the city itself are of",
         "the 12 Pk AIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT best possible character. The public schools are unsurpassed, and the hiph schools are of a specially modem type, in relation to industrial and technical, as well as academic training^. The public and business buildinjfs are generally eood. The manufacturing: interests of the city include the making of flour, biscuits, soap, lumber, cured meats, wire fencing, ajrricultural imple-ments, leather goods, cigars, pickles, clothing, and articles of iron. The largest abattoirs in Western Canada are at Winnipeg. Its interests are largely railway and commercial, but it will no doubt increase in importance in manu-facturing. Brandon is situated on the Assiniboine River, about 125 miles west of Winnipeg. It is on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and on a branch of the Canadian Northern Railway, and is the terminus of a branch of the Great Northern as well as of a number of other branch lines. It has a college and good local educa-tional services. One of the Provincial Asylums, an Industrial School, and a Dominion Experi-mental Farm are located at Brandon. It has manufactures of lumber, woollen goods, and farm implements. It is supported by a fine grain and live-stock district, being specially well known for its draught horses. Portage la Prairie is situated about midway between Winnipeg and Brandon in thfe centre of a highly productive district called the Portage Plains. It is an important railway point. It has the three great Canadian main line systems, and a number of branch lines. An Indian Industrial School and the Provincial Home for Incurables are situated at Portage la Prairie. It has large elevators and flour-mills. Towns The towns of Manitoba are local market towns in most cases, and their growth is limited to the growth of the districts they serve. Some of them have already developed large business in-terests owing to the wealth of production and the rapid improvements about them, and a few are aided by special industries in addition to the grain and retail trades. St. Boniface, opposite Winnipeg on the Red River, has woollen-mills, flour-mills and brick yards. It is connected with the capital by a number of bridges. It has a French College and Normal School, a fine Roman Catholic Cathedral and Convent. It has interesting historical associations. West Selkirk is at the head of Lake Winnipeg, and is connected with Winnipeg by a suburban line. It has lumber-mills, a nsh-hatchery, and large fish trade. An asylum for the insane is situated at Selkirk. Stonewall, also north of Winnipeg, has large quarries. Near Stonewall is Stony Mountain, where the Provincial Peni-tentiary is located. Carberry SinCi Virden are grain shipping points on the Canadian Pacific west of Winnipeg. The latter is one of the most attractive residential towns in the province. Dauphin is a divisional ix)int on the main line of the Canadian Northern Railway, and is the market centre for a large agricultural district between the Riding and Duck Mountains on the west, and Lake Dauphin on the east. The country is specially adapted to mixed farming. Other towns to the north are Grand View and Swan River. Neepawa, Gladstone, Minnedosa, Birtle, Bin- scarth, and Russell are situated on the Yorkton branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Neepa-wa is the centre of a rich country known as the Beautiful Plains. Minnedosa lies in the valley of the Little Saskatchewan. Both towns have railway connection with Brandon. Morden, Manitou, Killarney, Boissevain, and Deloraine are on the Deloraine branch of the Canadian Pacific. They are among the oldest towns of the province, and are centres for highly developed agricultural districts. Melita,Napinka, Souris, Treherne, and Carman are flourishing market towns on the Glenbow branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Souris is an important divisional point and has flour- mills and other mai '\"cturing interests.

It lies west of the second meridian as far south as latitude 56 from which point the meridian between ranges 29 and 30 west of the principal meridian forms the dividing line to the international boundary. The 110th meridian separates it from the pro-vince of Alberta. TAe Cnlhgf, oneofllu many stately buM„,g.s, Univ.rs.ty of tMskptchevan, Saskatoon. Area. The province extends for 750 miles from north to south, and is 250 miles wide at the north and 400 miles wide at the south. Its area is 250,000 square miles. Surface. The characteristic surface features of the southern part of Saskatchewan are those of the second prairie .steppe. Though the con-ventional boundaries of the province do not correspond with the natural b(nmdaries of this elevation, the greater part of the second prairie steppe is included in the province. The province of Manitoba includes a small portion of this elevation, while the province of Saskatchewan cuts off a similar portion in the south-western corner from the third prairie steppe. Saskatche-wan is midway between Manitoba and Alberta with respect to elevation and surface aspect. Its average elevation is about 1,600 feet, and its surface, while not showing great variations, It slightly more rolling than the surface o.' Manitoba. Its rivers show deefHJr channels, and buttes and groups of hills are more common. The chief elevations of the southern part of the province are the series of elevations marking the eastern and western boundaries of the second prairie steppe. Tho.se lying within the province on the east side are the Porcupine and Pasquia Hills, and on the west side the Dirt Hills, the Coteaii, Hear Hills, and Eagle Hills. Other isolated elevations or groups of hills are Moose Mountain. Touchwood Hills. Wood Mountain and Cypress Hills. Smaller elevations, called buttcs.\" (K-cur in the southern parts of the province. The pi vince north of the 52nd parallel is diversified by bluffs and an increas-ing number of patches of scrub and soft timber but with large stretches of open land. North of the North Saskatchewan River the land is (|uite diversified in aspect and surface. Wooded areas become more prominent, the timber is larger, and the country is well watered by numerous lakes and streams. The Laurentian Plateau reaches into the province on the north-east corner. Tlie southern part of the province is not marked by many large lakes. They are usually local basins, and are not connected with the .vreneral drainage system. Many of them are alkaline. The most important are Chaplin Johnston, Last Mountain, and Big Quill' Farther north are Lake Jlontreal and Lac La Ronge. At the head of the Churchill is a chain of lakes, chief of which are Island, Clear and Buffalo lakes. The largest lakes of the province are those skirting the Laurentian Plateau of which Reindeer, Wollaston. and Athabaska are the most important. With the exception of Chaplin, Johnston, and Quill, these lakes are usually well stocked with fish. Drainage. The general slope of the province IS easteriy or slightly north-easterly. The Hudson Bay receives the major part of the drainage, but the northern part is drained to the Arctic Ocean through the Mackenzie system and a small strip south of the height of land to the Gulf of Mexico through the Mississippi system. The chief rivers flowing east are the Souns and Qu'Appelle, both rising in",

ImiKirtant tribut.iries of the North anrl Stjuth Saskatchewan are the Rattle River and the Red Deer, botli risinj,' in Alberta and joininjr the North and South Saskatchewan in Saskatchewan. The Churchill is fed by a series of lakes and small rivers on the western side of the province. The greater part of I^ke Athabaska lies within the province, its chief tributary beinp the Chipman. It is drained to Great Slave Lake by the Slave River, antl thence to the Arctic Ocean by the Mackenzie River. Two small streams called Rattle Creek and Frenchman River flow south, and become tributary to the Missouri. Climate. The province of Saskatchewan, by reason of its ix)siti\"n in the interior of the con-tinent, and becau^ it is situated in the tem-perate zone, has an extreme climate. The south-western part of the province, however, has milder winters than the rest of the pro-vince, owing: to the influence of the Chin(x\u003ek winds. It is likewise drier in summer. The winter season is generally steady and the snow-fall is fairly heavy. The atmosphere is clear, dry, and bracing. The snow is light and dry. High winds are not common in winter, but when they occur occasionally develop into severe storms on account of the lightness of the snow. The snowfall is slightly heavier in the north than in the south. The average annual precipitation of the pnn-ince is between fifteen and twenty inches, two thirds of which occurs between April and September. High tempera-tures are sometimes reached during the summer days, but the nights are always cool and in-vigorating. The country is free from violent atmospheric disturbances. The climate on the whole, and in conjunction with the phenomenal excellence of the land, makes for the highest success in wheat growing. The progress of crops in spring and early summer is very rapid, and the ripening process is intensified by the bright sunshine and dry weather of ha*' time. mDUSTKIU AlID REIODtCBt Africnlttira. The province of Saskatchewan is essentially an agricultural country, four-fifths of the population being engageil in agricultural pursuits. Its oiwratiois are commonly on a large scale, steam an.l gasoline |H)wer being employed in the larger enterprises. The soil is very fertile and endu-ing, and the climate ideal for the prcxluction of the best ixissible nuality of cereals, r(X)ts, and grasses. The growing sea.v)n is marked by liberal rainfall, alxiut half of the precipitation falling within the months of May, Jur.c, and July, and the harvesting pericxl by ccntinuoiis, bright, dry weather.

Barley, oats, and flax succeed equally well, and all classes of vegetables and small fruits are grown in abundance. The usual varieties of tame hay yield heavily, and the prairie furnishes large quantities of native hay. Practically all development is south of the North Saskatchewan River ; but the open stretches of country to the north, where the soil is of great depth and fertility, will display heavy production in the near future. In the best settled parts of the country dairying and live-stock interests are developing rapidly. Herds of registered stock .^re cnrrmnr!, and special feeding enterprises are carried on at the large elevator towns. The \"park district\"",

The south-west comer of the province was formerly ^iven over to ranchinjr on account of the suitability of its climate to winter jTrazinjf. but the .\u003ei)en ranjre area is beinjf rapidly settled by the home-steader. Ranjfe proi)erties in horses, cattle. • ind sheep .still persist, but larjre holdiuKs are becominjf impossible. Lumbering. The extreme southern part of the province is wholly open prairie, but patches of brush and light timber appear in the northern half of the part of the province south of the North Sa.skatchewan. The timber in tiiis district is chiefly pole timber, which is use-ful for local settlers. The men hintable timber grow- north of the Saskatchewan, and it occurs in such (|uantity as to form the bjisis of an active industry in lumber, and to become an important .source of suiiply for the province. The timber is white spruce, which jrrr)ws to a size of from two to three feet in diameter, and black spnice, birch, tamarack, and jack pine, the last beinjr used i)rinci|)ally for ties. Prince Albert is the centre of the lumber indu.stiy. Fur Trading is still an important industry. The chief furs takei are bear, otter, beaver, mink, wolf, marten, and musk-ox. The chief fur-tradinjT centres are Prince Albert and Hattleford. The output is valued at S200,000 annually. Mining is carried on principally in the Souris district. The coal is li«rnite, and does not com-pete with the harder varieties of Alberta coal, except locally. The two chief centres at which coal is mined are Bienfait and Roche Percee. Including the Wood Mountain, Cypress Hills, and Willow Bunch districts alunjr with the Souris, the e.stimated coal area in Saskatche-wan is 7,500 square miles, with an estimated tonnag-e of twenty billions. About 200,000 tons were mined in 1910. Gold is found in small quantities in the sands of the North Sas-katchewan. Fishing is yearly becoming more imiwrtant. The northern lakes abound with a «-ood quality of whitefish, pike, pickerel, and sturgeon, which are caught through the ice in winter-time. Tile industry not only furnishes larKc local supplies of fcMKl. but is the basis of an imiwrtant trade with e; stern and southern markets. Manufacturing. The most imin.nant manu-facturing interests are those connected with the c(mverting of cereals into fixKls. Flour-mills are comnu-n throughout the i)rovince. The makingof cement and bricks is a thriving and important industry. TransporUUon. Three railway companies are ojH-rating in the province. The Canadian Pacific mair line and the Porta:.re la Prairie- Wetaskiwin branch traverse the province. From Moosejaw the Soo line runs south-east, leaving the province at Portal, and the Lacomlie branch runs north-west. The com-pany has T my other short lines. The Cana-dian Northern and Grand Trunk Pacific main lines nm almost parallel to each other north-westerly through the province. The Canadian Northern has important lines connecting Kegina, Saskatwm, and Prince Albert, and Prince Albert with Dauphin, Man., as well as a number of other branches in the southern part of the i)rovince. The Grand Trunk Pacific has a number of branch lines in ccjurse \u003c\u003e( construction. Th.jn is considerable need of colcmization roads, to make the resources of the north available to the .southern part of the province. CITIES Ktgina, the capital of Saskatchewan, is on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway and on the southern branch of the Canadian Northern Railway, running from Winnipeg to Prince Albert. It is the terminus of the Areola and Moose M.juntain section of the Canadian Pacific between Brandon and Regina, and is connected with the Grand Tnmk Pacific by a branch from Melville. It is an imponant terminal point for both the Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk Pacific lines. The district surrounding Regina is one of the best wheat sections in western Canada, and it has under-gone rapid development in the last few vears. The city has a large distributing business north, south, and west, and a heavy local trade supported by the productive area tributary",

A branch of the same line runs from Saskatoon to Caljjary. The facilities of the city for distribution could scarcely be improveil ujxjn. It is already an active com-mercial centre. Its j;-rowth from a villajfc to an imjxjrtant city has all taken pUice in half a dozen years. The district around Saskatoon is an excellent grain and stock country, and is already highly improved. The Provincial University is located at Saskatoon. Among the faculties of the University, that of agriculture is being given prominence, in order to relate the work of the university to the dominant interests of the province. A large experi-mental farm is part of the university site. One of the Provincial Normal Schools is located here. Moosejaw is on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It is a divisional point, and an important junction point on the Canadian Pacific. It is the junction of the Soo line nmning south-west through Portal to St. Paul, and of a branch running north-west by Outlook, to Lacombe, Alta. Many new lines and branches are projected. There are large shops in the city for the work of the company. The country around Moosejaw is excellent wheat land, and is well settled. The city has large elevator capacity, one of the largest flour-mills in the west, and large abattoir and stock yards. Feeding enterprises are carried on from the elevator waste and screenmgs. The city has excellent schools, churches, nnu other public buildings, and Mubstantiul business bliK-ks. Prince Albtrt is situated on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan on a site of great naturoi beauty. It is the terminus of the Regina and Prince Albert branch of the Canadian North-ern, and of a branch of the same line from Dauphin, Man. Extensions of this line south-west to Battleford and north-west toward Lake Athabaska are now being made. A branch of the Grand Trunk Pacific from Young is nearing completion. Prince Albert is the centre for the lumber trade and the fish ;rade of the province, which are both expanding rapidly. It has large flour-mills and a large packing plant. It is the chief fur em]X)rium of the province, and the most important distributing t\u003eoint for supplies to the north. Power is being developed from the rapids of the Saskatchewan east of the city. It is making rapid i)rogrcss in the establishment of goiKl schools and other services and utilities. The country about Prince Albert has a deep black soil of great fertility. North Dattleford is an important city and a divisional point on the Canadian Northern Rail-way. A branch line runs north. It is situated on the north side \u003c ' rli . ' irth .Sass.'.v.-hcwan River. TOWNS The growth of towns with resi)ect to both number and size has been very rapid. There are already over fifty towns and four times as many incorporated villages in the province. The transportation involved in the immense wheat production of the province has made immense elevator capacity necessary, which has given rise to a great number of market iwints on all lines of railway. Many of them are of local imix)rtance only, but the growth of branch lines of railway has already increased the busi-ness and traffic of a number of jxjints to take account of wider relations than those of the immediate district. Most of the larger towns exemplify an active municipal spirit, and own and oixjrate their own public utilities.

While the surfar is diversified in comparison with the surf . \u003ef Manitoba and Saskatchewan, it is not marked by any important structural elevations. elevations occur in isolate.l «Toups of hills, as in the case of the Hand, Beaver, HIackfr-.f ;.-.,] part of the Cypress Hills. Smallerrej-ularl'y formed elevations called \"buttes\" appear in different irts of the prairie. The prairie",
         "is 18 PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT deeply cut bj' its rivers. CorrcspondiriK' to the canyons of the mountain area, steep banks of clay, locally known as \" cutbanks,\" flank tbc sides of the rivers in the prairie area often to a depth of 300 feet from the prairie level or \"bench land.\" The area adjacent to the rivers is diversified by \"coulees\" running' back from the rivers at rijrht angles for lon.wr distances into the prairie. The Dominion Government has established two imptjrtant game reservations in the prairie area east and south-east of Edmonton. Elk Island Park at Lamont consists of 16 sciuarc miles, and Buffalo Park at Wainwrijjht of 162 square miles. These are larsrely for the preservation of a herd of eipht hundred prairie buffalo pur-chased in Montana. The mountain area of Alberta lies in the southern half of the province. It embraces a strip about sixty miles wide on the western side of the province, bein.tj the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. The eastern slope oT the Rockies is rather abrupt, and the surface is irregfular. It has no supportinj,^ structural elevation parallel to the main ranj^e, and is deeply cut by canyons and ravines. The general elevation of the main ran.ue of the Rockies in Alberta and of the lands lyin.i; away from the mountains, is greatest in the south. The chief peaks are Mount Brown, 16,000 feet; Mount Hooker, 13,500 feet; and Mount Murchi- son, 13,500 feet. The mountains are traversed by the follovvinRf passes, which are important as channels for transportation across the moun-tains : North Kootenay, 6,600 feet ; Crowsnest, 5,500 feet ; Kicking Horse, 5,300 ; Yellow- head, 3,733 feet; Pine River, 2,850 feet, and Peace River, 2,000 feet. The Kicking- Horse and Crowsnest are traversed by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Yellowhead by the Grand Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern railways. In the mountain area of the province, the Dominion Government has set apart large areas for forest and game preservation and for recrea-tive purposes. They are patrolled by fire and game guardians, and are being improved by the construction of roads and trails to facilitate sigbt-seeing. The chief reserves in the moun-tains are Rocky Mountains Park and Jasper Park, containing 4,500 and 5,000 square miles resiiectively. Rocky Mountains Park is situated on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Rail-way. It is watered principally by the Bow River. Two important resorts within the park are Banflf and Laggan ; the former very popular on account of its hot springs, and the latter for its natural beauty. Jasper Park is on the main line of the Grand Trunk Pacific. It is watered by the Athabaska, and has hot si)rings, which are near the Yellowhead Pass. The govern-ment sanatorium is located at this point. The progress of the railway up the vall°y of the Athabaska is by a route of great scenic beauty. The government has also a reservation of fifty- four stpiare miles at Waterton Lake. The area north of the North Saskatchewan River is skirted for some distance by the Rocky Mountains, but is for the most part an imdulat- ing plain. Its elevations appear as prominent isolated hills or groups of hills, chief of which arc the Carilxxi, Clear, Birch, and Buffalo Head. The north-eastern corner of the province is rough and broken in character from the cross-ings of this area by the Laurentian formation. Farther south, areas of sand are found on the eastern boundary of the province. The interior of the northern part of the province between the Peace and Athabaska rivers is well watered, and has stretches of muskeg which will become valuable when drained. The rivers in the north enter the province by deep channels, flanked in some cases by regular terraces rising back to the level of the prairie . The Peace and Athabaska rivers spread into broad deltas at their mouths. The lakes of the province are not important in the south, beir : generally shallow local basins or sloughs wiiich ..brink in volume and area after the s ring and early summer rains. The largest is Pakowki. In central Alberta larger bodies of water occur, such as Beaver, Bittern, Pigeon, Cooking, Sullivan, Birch, Gull, and Wabamim — lakes which are large enough to carry small craft. The lakes in the northern part of the province occur usually as part of the drainage system. The most important of these are Lac La Biche, Lesser Slave Lake, and Lake Claire, belonging to the Athabaska",
         "system. PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT 19 The southern part of the pnn-ince is treeless except alonK: the bottom lands of the rivor.s ami in the mountains. The side of the coulees ex-posed to the north is frcpiently covereil with short low scrub. In the central part of the province clumps of scrub and li^ht timber alter-nate \"'ith larire prairie stretches. The river hr-y,:^ :.r,,: liiiibered, particularly in the upper 1' vols. In tin- II . r hern part of the province the p.ov.'i is consi. arably heavier and the areas lt:V-tr. Ou'sid of the upper waters of the nveis, tiic uLi'-f forest areas are on the east side of the Athabaska and between the Athabaska and the Peace. The country north and west of the Peace is generally open, with occasional patches of scrub ; and south of the Peace River and west of the Smoky, and includinjr the Grande Prairie and Spirit River district, is open prairie. Drainage. There are three j,aoat draina,i,^e sys-tems repicsented in Alberta-- the Mackenzie. Saskatchewan-Xel.son, and Mississipj.i. The Peace and Athabaska rivers drain the north-ern part, their waters i)assingr by the Great Slave River and Great Slave Lake int., the Mackenzie, and finally into the Arctic Ocean. The Peace River enters Alberta from British Columbia in an easterly direction, turns north-easterly and enters the Slave River a short distance north of Lake Athaba.^ka. Its impor-tant tributaries are the Smoky, Wabiskaw and Red rivers. The Athabaska River rises in Alberta, flows north-ea.st and finally north into Lake Athabaska. Its important tributaries are the Macleod, Pembina, Lesser Slave, and Clear-water. The North and South Saskatchewan rivers drain most of the southern part. They unite in the province of Saskatchewan and. joining: the waters of the Red River in Lake Winnipesr, form the Nelson River, which empties into Hudson Hay. Both branches of the Sas-katchewan rise in Alberta and flow in an easterly direction. The chief tributary of the North Saskatchewan is the Battle River. The chief tributaries of the South Saskatchewan are: on the north side, the Bow and the Red Deer rivers, and on the .south, the Bellv River with its tributaries the Little Bow, Old Man, and St. Marys. The Milk River, which flows throujjh the province for a distance of one hundred miles just north of the international boundary, joins the Missouri River in Montana, and pas.ses by way of the Mississi|)pi into the Gulf of Mexico. Climate. The climate of Alberta is usually described, alonjr with that of the rest of the prairie provinces, as extreme ; but this is sub-ject to important and characteristic exceptions. The ran«:e between hij^h and low temperature IS scarcely as wide as in the other prairie provinces. The summer seasons are not marked by excessive heat, the nij^hts beinj,^ always cool, and the riRors of winter are broken by frequent visits of the Chinook winds. The influence of the Chinook is greatest in that part of the pro-vince south of Red Deer, but the same general influence for which it stands has some effect over the whole province, and distinctly so in A:,„r/„;,jr Srene in .Uherta-CatlU Herdi ■ng. the upper valley of the Peace River. The econo-mic and industrial significance of the Chinook influence is scarcely realized. With the filling up of the southern strip of the prairie provinces as far west as the Rocky Mountains, the move-ment of the homeseeking population for agricul-tural lands must necessarily be north. The climatic limitations to this northward movement are not great in Alberta. Good grain and vege-tables are grown to the northern limits of the province, and a vast development of Northern Alberta will follow colonization railways if they are constructed. The influence of the Chinook extends into Saskatchewan for some distance and moderates the climate of the south-west part of the province. The precipitation averages sixteen or eighteen inches annually. The greater part of the rain-fall occurs in the months of Mav, June, and",
         "July 20 PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT m INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES Agriculture. The jirovince f)f Alberta is im- purtant ajrriculturally, not only on account of its .irencral fertility, but on account of its rapid proj^res.s in diversified lines of ajfricultural work. The rancher, prain grower, dairyman, stock grower, and irrigator have appeared side by side or in quick succession within a decade as highly efficient i)roducers. The country south of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and to a lesser extent for a hundred miles north of it, was formerly devoted to ranch-ing. It is what is known as a short-grass country. The naturally cured prairie grasses of low growth furnished fo.id to stock summer and winter. Recently this area has been invaded by the settler, and has been changed to a grain- Fnrm Flock near Edmimton. producing country. Though having sufficient absolute precipitation for grains, grasses, and nxjt crops, the work of the Chinook has made it necessary to check evaporation by a special method of culture, called dry farming, a method generally followed throughout the prairie prov-inces. It is briefly a plan of preparing soil, by deep and thorough tillage, to receive moisture and of ])rcventing evaporation from capillary action by frecpiently stirring the surface soil to make a dust blanket. This method, consistently followed, successfully removes danger of failure from drouth. Three imjKirtant irrigation enterprises have been inaugurated within this area at Calgary, Lethbridge, and Medicine Hat, which will arti-ficially water a total area of about 2,500,000 acres of land. A few small ranch enterprises still persist in the southern and south-eastern part of the pro-vince, but grain-growing, principally of winter wheat, spring wheat, oats, and barley are general. Alfalfa and sugar beets are important croDs in irrigatetl lands, and stock enterprises on the farms are increasing in number and importance. Central Alberta is devoted to mixed farming and dairying. It is a country of choice dairy and beef herds and of a gofjd class of horse stock. The butter output amounts to about 2,500,000 pounds annually. Hog raising is becoming an important industry. Winter and spring wheat and barley are satisfactory crops, an\u003cl oats grow in the highest perfection. Northern Alberta is undergoing development. The land of the Upper Peace River Valley is being settled, and rapid .settlement will follow transportation over the greater part of the country, which is generally good land, and which has been demonstrated to be fitted for the growth of good cereal, vegetable, and fodder crops almost to its northsm boundary. Lumbering. The lumber industry is not yet important from the standpoint of total produc-tion. Timber growth south of the North Sas-katchewan is limited largely to cottonwood and poplar, the latter being locally useful. Saw logs of spruce, pine, and birch are floated down the Saskatchewan to Edmonton. The northern part of the province is rich in timber resources in the forest areas between the Peace and Athabaska and east of the Athabaska, the chief varieties being jack-pine, balsam, spruce, poi)lar, and birch. Mining. Alberta possesses a great wealth of coal. Its distribution extends from the inter-national boundary to the Peace River, and from the mountains well toward the eastern boundary of the province. The quality varies from lignite to anthracite, the harder quality being found in the neighbourhood of the mountains. The chief centres of the industry are Taber, Lethbridge, Blairmore, Coleman, Frank, Lundbreck, Hill- crest, and Lille on the Crowsnest Railway ; Bankhead and Canmore on the main line of the Canadian Pacific, and Edmonton, Clover Bar, Tofield, Morinville, and Cardiff in the Edmonton district. Large coal properties are in",

The total area of coal land is estimated at 16,000 s,iuare miles. Gold is found in payi„« ....antilics in the sands of the North Saskatchewan and Peace nvers. Oil wells have been sunk at Morinville and near Cardston. Important results are looked for from the work of iKdf a do.en companies borin^r alon^^ the Athabaska C; ts .s found in Medicine Hat in quantitv to answer for light, fuel, and power purposes,' and also at Bow Island. There are lar^e salt deposits neu- Fort Smith. Immense beds of tar sands arc ^een east of the Athabaska River, which with transportation will prove ,.( .^rcat value for roadmakingf. Fur Trading. The taking of fur is still an important interest. It is tributary to Edmon-ton. The most important fur district is in the northern interior between the Peace and Atha-baska. Three companies, besides manv in-dividuals, are enj,rajjed in the traffic. Its value IS one million dollars annually. The furs are bear, beaver, mink, marten, fox, wolf, musk-ox coyote, etc. A large herd of wood buffalo' nrnibering from four to eight humlred, nm of the Peace in the north-west corner of -ovince. They are pn.tected hv federal : -^Illation. Fishing is important in relation to local f(,oci supply in the north and centre of the ,.rovinee The northern lakes are heavily st.x-ked with trout, whitefish, pickerel, and pike. The in-dustry will become i-.nportant with the establish-ing of t: . nsportation . Transportation. The province is served bv the Canadian Pacific, the Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific. The main line of the Canadian Pacific enters the prox ince about sixty-five miles north of the international boundary, and runs in a general north-westerly direction through Calgary, leaving the province by the Kicking Horse Pass. The Crowsnest division leaves the main line at Dunm.-re junc-tion, runs almost directly west through Leth- bridgeand Macleod, and enters British Columbia by the Crowsnest Pass. A branch connects Lctii- bridge and Calgary. The Canadian Pacific PRAIRIP PROVINCE SrpPLKM::XT 21 Railway Company contn.ls and operates a line formerly owned by the Alberta Railwa\\- and rngation Company, running so„tli-e.ist in.m Lcthbrulgc to the boundary, and a branch of the same line from Stirling- running south-west to heyou.l Cardston. A line runs directly north and south from Macleod, thnnigh Calgary, to tdmontor.and two branch lines running north-west from M,K)sejaw an\u003cl Saskatoon join the north and .south line at Lacombe an\u003cl Wetaski- wiii resi)ectively. The Canadian Northern main line running north-westerly between Winnipeg and Ednion- U\u003en crosses the Saskatchewan River at Fort buskatchewan. A line runs to Athabaska Land- y,.r,r/,on „fthc Echo and Bo-u- Rhrrs, Banjff^ i\"M- n\u003c,nh, aiul others run west from ICdnK.nton. ; '•- '\"\"\u003e\" '■•\"'-■ will ultimately run to Vancouver I'.v way of the Vellowhcad Pass. A line con-nects \\ egrcville and Calgary. The Grand Trunk Pacific also runs from ^\\ .nmpeg to Edmontcm in the .same general cl.rect.on a little farther south, and nins west to the Athabaska River, following the river sou h-west and cro.ssing the mountains by the \\ e lowhea.l Pass. A line connects Tofield an\u003cl l-algary. The advent of railways has done awav with water transportation in .southern Alberta. Stern- wheel steamers ply on the Athabaska Pe-ice and North Saskatchewan rivers, and on Lesse^ Slave Lake. It is probable that the develop-ment of production will involve the improve-ment of transportation services on all the important rivers of the",

Tin- ( it v now includes what was formerly the two cities of Edmonton and Strathcona. The site is one of jrreat natural beauty. The river is spanned by the hi),di level railway and traffic bridK-e of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and by other brid.y:cs. It is on the main line of the (irand Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern railways, and is the i)resent terminus of the Caljjary and Edmonton division of the Canadian Pacific, as well as of a direct line from Winnipej;:. A number of lines of railway radiate from Ed-monton west, north-west, and north. A branch of the Canadian Northern Railway runs to Atha- baska Landinjj, and does a large distributing traffic for the north at this point. Extensions are projected north to Fort Murray, north-west to the Peace River, and also north-east. The city has important wholesale interests, large flour and lumber mills, brickyards, ironworks, and large abattoir and packing plants. It is the largest frontier fur emporium in North America. It has a good class of commercial and public buildings, more especially schools. It is the seat of the Provincial University, which is situated on a site comprising two hundred and fifty-eight acres, with a view to permit of suitable expansion into experimental and demonstration work in relation to the teaching of agricultural science. The scope of the work of the university is expanding rapidly through the policy of receiv-ing in affiliatitm colleges which are serving the denominational interests of the ]irovince. Calgary is the largest city of the province. It is situated in a valley between the Bow and the Elbow rivers, and is on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, on a line of the same road nmning from Macleod to Edmonton, and has shops and terminal facilities. It will like-wise be served by branch lines of the Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk Pacific lines from Saskatoon, Tofield, and Vegreville. The city has large wholesale interests, and distributes west, north, and south. It has large mills, brickyards, cement works, breweries, foundries, stone quarries, harness manufactory, and meat-packing concerns. The city is substantially built of local sandstone, and has good banks, business blocks, colleges, schools, and churches. The Provincial Normal School is located at Calgary. Calgary is the headquarters of one of the largest irrigation enterprises on the conti-nent. The irrigated lands are being converted to heavy production of grains, grasses, sugar- beets and other roots, vegetables, and small fruits. Calgary, which was formerly a ranch-ing centre, is now an important district for registered and highly improved cattle, sheep, and more especially horses. I.cthbrid^c, situated on the Belly River, is a divisional point on the Crowsnest Railway, and is the hcad(in,irters of the former Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company's line. It has a line run-ning north-west, and it vill be the terminus of a line from Weyburn. It is the centre of the first large irrigation enterprise in Canada. The irrigated lands in the district are producing grain, roots, alfalfa, and other fodder crops abundantly. The district is well settled as respects both irrigated and unirrigated lands. Winter wheat is an important crop. One of the Dominion Experimental Farms is situated near the city. The Gait coal is mined at Leth- bridge, and a number of other important mines operate in close proximity. The city is wholly modern with respect to educational and other services and iitilities. Medicine Hal is situated on the South Sa- katchewan River and on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, a .short distance east of its point of junction with the Crowsnest branch. It is a divisional point. The city has large supplies of natural gas which furnishes light, power, and fuel at low cost. It is owned by the city. It furnishes power to the shops of the railway, and fuel and power to an immense manufacturing concern east of the city. The Alberta Clay Products Company manufactures pressed, glazed, and fire brick, sewer and dn.in tile, and a variety of other clay products. There is a provincial demonstration farm adjoining the city devoted to showing the ,','orking of the best dry-farming practice. The district about Medi-cine Hat was formerly oi\u003ce of the most important ranch areas in the west. It is rapidly",
         "losing PRAIRIE PROVINCE SUPPLEMENT this character, and has already become a ,rrain- jrrowmgr and mixed farminj? district. The city is compactly built. It has jrowl public and busi- ness buildiiiK-s, substantial ilnirchcs, schools, and homes. U'elaskiwin is situated on the Battle River and on the Calj,'ary and Edniontcjii Railway, about forty miles south of EdnK.nton. It is the junction point of the Saskatoon section of the Canadian Pacific with the Calj,'ar/ aid Edmonton division. The city is the centre of a fine grain and stock -^rowinj,' country, and has large elevator interests. TOWNS The development of trans-portation interests has led to the establishment of a great number of new towns, the ultimate importanccof which can scarcely be forecasted. Places of any size are con-fined to central and southern Alberta. In central Alberta and in the lines tributary to Edmonton, the towns of l'ertni/io», WgrevUlt, Foil Saskatchn^ati , and part of IJoydminstcr are on the Canadian Northern Railway to the east, and AUiabaska Landing, Morinxille, and St. Albert to the north. demonstration farm and is a divisional point, and Athabaska L.inding is the farthest point nonh to which the railvay has penetrated in the western interior of Canada. It has a pro-vincial demonstration farm. Morinville has large coal mines. Tojleld and Wainuright are thriving places on the Grand Trunk Pacific on the east, and Edson on the west of Edmonton. Ponoka, on the Calgary and Edmonton line, is the seat of the provincial asylum. * RedDeer\\^ the largest town between Edmonton and Calgary. It is situated on Red Deer River, has mills and brickyards, and is surrounded by a good grain-growing and live-stock country.

         "is ROLL OF PUPILS 0F UPPER CANADA COLLEGE. Naturally. young Canadians were attracted by the great struggle in the States; and many of them took part in it on the one side or on the other. On the Union side were J. U. Crawford, A. Helliwell, Robert Kerr, and C. P. Lawrence. Robert Kerr will easily be recognized as the well known C. P. Ry. official of recent years. On the Confederate side was W. R. Burgess, who was neyer beard of again. but was numbered among the \"missing.\" Stili more naturally did \"Old Boys\" take service in our owni Militia or la the Regular Army, considering the fact that froin the very beginning Toronto had been a Garrison town. though, in very early days. the Gar- tison is spoken of as being two miles f rom town. That is not to be wondered at, secing that the earliest seulement was in the neighbourhood of the Don, and that the first incorporation covered a very small area, with George Street as its western limit. Unhappily, it is inmpossible to give a coi.iplete list of the \"Old Boys\" wbo have taken up Arms as a profession, or even of those wbo bave volunteered for any special service. Among the former may be cited the naines of Benson. Cameron. Colborne, Crease. Denison, Dunn (V.C.), Frith. Hodgins. Otter, Robinson. Taylor, WVood, Biscoe, and Young. At the tîme of Mackenzie*s Rebellion the boys clanioured to be allowed to take arms, but Sir Francis Bond Head very wisely refused to grant their request. mierely allowing theml to do guard duty, as was dont likewise in 1866. at the tire of the first Fenian Raid. lIn Ranking B3ook L. there is an entry to the effect that the distribution of przsfor tbe vear 1837 took place. neot in December of that year, as it ordinrl woutd bave done, but on the 26tb of February. 1838,--shortlv before Dr. Harris' final departure f roui Toronto.

Old Guard advanced ta the. charge; tde Coiborne. who as Napier says. was 'a mnan of singular talent for war,' suddenly fired a volley into the. flank of the. dense column, and then ciiarged it and ruted it. Wiiether this charge of Colhone' realIy defemted the. OId Guard and won the. battle of Waterloo is a point whicb wiIl alwavs b. disputed, but it is perfectly certain that lie defeated a body of the. guard, éither the. main guard or a detaciied portion, and mbost prob- ably the. second lin..
