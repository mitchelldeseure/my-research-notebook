         "INTRODUCTION The material included in this pamphlet is more particularly intended for reference purposes. In treating of the Neutrality of Belgium and the chronological sketch leading up to the events of the war, the material being adapted from \"Why We Are at War\" by members of the Oxford faculty of modern history, an attempt is made to clearly define the issue at stake, and the negotiations which led up to the participation of the British Empire in the Euro- pean struggle. The Ambassadorial correspondence which preceded the outbreak of hostilities brought to the public attention persons holding import- ant positions in the diplomatic service of the various countries. A list of these, with their official positions, is given, which will be of assistance in reading the official \"Blue Book\" issued by the Imperial Government. Following the diplomatie controversy and after the outbreak of war, the political situation in Britain underwent a change, and on May 26, 1915, a Coalition Ministry was formed. The personnel of this Ministry is given as an illustration of the unity of purpose with which British Statesmen met the greatest crisis of history. The dictionary of \"war terms\" has been collected from articles in the public press and military works, and will facilitate the reading of war news, and also aid teachers in explaining methods of modern warfare. Not of the least importance is the glossary of names and places connected with the war with their proper pronunciation. While it is impossible in many cases to be absolutely correct in pronouncing foreign names-many of their sounds having no equivalent in Eng- lish-the pronunciation given will be found the more universally 5",
         "accepted. As an illustration of how to use the \"Key to Pronunci- ation\" take the word \"AKABA\". It will be noted that the accent ()is above each of the vowels. By reference to the key the accent Ç9above the vowel \"a\" denotes that the vowel has the full open sound as in \"far.\" The writer is indebted to IDr. W. A. R. Kerr, Professor of Modern languages, Tlniversit.y of Alberta, for reviewing and criticising this part of the work. IR. A. BARRON, IDepartment of Education May 1Ith, 1916.",
         "NEUTRALITY 0F BELGIUM The Provinces whichi now constitute the kingdom of Belgium- with the exception of the bishopric of Liege, which was until 1795 an ecclesiastical principality-were known in the seventeenth century as the Spanish, in the eighteenth as the Autstrian, Nether- lands. They received the first of these nianes when they returned to the allegiance of Philip II, after a short participation in the ievolt to which Holland owes ber national existence. When the independence of Holland was finally recognized by Spain (16=48) the Spanish Neth- (rands were subjected to the first of the articifical restrictions which Europe has seen fit to imipose upon them. The Duteli monopoly of navigation in the Scheldt was admitted by the rfreaty of Munster (1648) and Antwerp, was thus precluded from developingr into a rival Arnsterdama. In the age of Louis the XIV the Spanish Nether- lands were constantIy attacked by France, who acquired at one time or another the chief towns of Artois and Hainault, including some which have Iately corne into prorninence in the great war. suchi as Lille, Valenciennes, Camhray, and Maubeuge. The bulk, how'ever, of the Spanish Net.herlands paesed at the Treaty of Ut.recht to Aust.ria, then the chief rival of F rance on the Continent. They passed -%with the reservation that. certain fortresses on their southern border were to be garrisoned jointly by the Dutch and the Austrians as a barrier against Frenchi aggression. This arrangement -was overthrown nt the Frenchi Revolution. The French annexed. the Austrian Nethierlands and Liege in Novemiber, 1792. Lt becamne apparent in the Napoleonic Wars tlat Belgiurn -nd Holland were individually too weak to protect. themselves or the German people against an aggressivc French Government. The allies, therefore, in the year 1813, handed over to Holland the Aus- trian Netherlands and the bishopric. of Lie(ge in order te put Holland in a position to resRist attzack until the powers could come to its aid. This arrangement w-as ratified at. the Trat-y of Chaumon1t (1814). As there was no government or visible unity in the Belgian provinces",
         "after the retirement of the rirench, the union with Holland, originally suggested by Lord Castlereagh, seemed reasonable enough. It gave the Belgians the great privilege of freely navigating the Scheidt. It was conflrmed at the Congress of Vienna, and the new kingdom of the United Nctherlands xvas declared neutral by the comînon consent of the Powers. But the events of the years 1815-1830 proved conciusively that this union was unsatisfactory to the Belgian population. The Belgians complained that they -%vere flot aliowed their just share of influence and representation in the legisiature or executive. They resented the attempt to impose the Dutch language and Dutch Liberalism upon them. They rose in revoit, expelled the Dutch officiais and garrisons, and drew up for themselves a monarchial and parliamentary constitution. Their aspirations aroused muchi sympathy both in England and in France. These two countries induced t.he other Great Powers (Austria, Prussia, Russia) to recog- nize the new hzingdom as an independent neutral state. This recog- nition was embodied in the Treaty of the Twenty-four Articles signed at London in October, 1831; and it wvas flot too generous to the aspirations of Belgian nationality. Since the Belgians had been defeated in the field by Holland and had ozîly been rescued by a French arniy, they w'ere obliged to surrender thieir claims upon Maest.richit, parts of Luxemnburg, and parts of Limburg. Somne time eiapsed before this settiement wvas recognized by Holland. But at length this last guarantee was obtained; and the Treaty of London, 1839, finaily established the international status of Belgium. Under this Treaty both lier independence and lier neuitrality were delinitely guaranteed by England, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia. \"«THE SORAP OF PAPER\" We have been toid by the Imperial Chancellor that the Treaty of 1839 is nothing but \";a, scrap of paper\". fI is therefore desirable to, point out that Bismarck made full use of it iii 1870 to prevent England from supporting the cause of France. It was with this objeet that hce publishied the proposai alleged to have been nmade to him by the rirencli representative, Benedetti, in 1866, that Frussia should hielp France to acquire Belgiuni as a solace for Prussiani annexations in Northern Gerrnany. Tien, as now, Euîgland insist.ed upon the Treat-y of 1839. The result. was thiat, on the instance of Lord Granville, Germany and France cntered into an Mdentie",
         "treaty with Great Britain (Aug. 1870) to the effeet that, if either belligerent violated Belgian territory, Great Britain would co-operate with the other .or the defence of it. The Treaty was most strictly construed. After the battie of Sedan (Sept. 1870) the German Government applied to Belgium for leave to transport the German wounded across Belgian territory. France protested that this would bc a breach of neutralit-y and Belgium refused. THE GEOGRAPRICAL SITUATION. It is evident to ail who study closely the map of France that bier eastern frontier fails into two sharply contrasted divisions, the north-eastern wvhich reache-s fromn the se\u0026 to the valley of the Sambre, and the south-easterni which extends from, that river to and along the Swiss; boundary. The former is fiat country, easy for rnilitary operations; the latter is mnountainous, intersec.ted -with many deep, valicys. After the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the French set to, work to rettify artifically the strategical *weakness of tiieir frontier; and in a chain of fortresses bebiind the Vosges Mountains they erected a rampart which bas tbe reputation of being inipregnable. This is the line Belfort, Epinal, Toul, Verdun. A Gerinai attackL launelbed upon tbis line without. violating neutral territory wvould have to be frontal, for on the niorth the hune is covered by the neutral states of Belgium and Luxemburg, wbile on tbe soutb althoughi the gap between the Vo0SgeS and tbe Swiss frontier apparently gives a chance of outflanking the French defences, tbe fortress of Belfort, which was nieyer reduced even in the War of 1870-1, was considered too formidable an obstacle against wbicbi to launch ait invading arnmy. A rapid advance on Paris was tberefore deemed impossible if respect were to, be paid to, the neut.rality of Belgium and Luxemburg, and it was for this purely milit.ary reason that, Germany bias today violated ber promises to, regard the neutralit-y of tbiese states. This was franly adniitted by flerr von Jagow to, Sir Edward Ciosclien; if they bad gone by the more southiern route tbey could not bave hoped, ini view of the paucity of roads and tbe st.reng-tb of the fortresses. to, have got tbroughi witbout. formidable opposition entailing great loss of time. In the case of ]3elgium a very eas-ýy road was afforded into French territory iii the Valley oi the 'Meuse, past Liege and thence into France past îNamur and through wbiat is known as the Gap of Namur. A German army could debouch into F rance through this gap the more 9",
         "easily inasmuch as the rirencli, relying on the neutrality of these two States, had not strongly fortifled the frontier from the Sea to Maubeuge. Moreover, as the ùcuntry to the west of the Sambre was very easy'country for manoeuvring and furnished with good roads and railways, it -%vas reckoned that the formidable French uines to the south could be turned in this manner, and the German army could mardi upon Paris from the north-east. That sucli a plan wvas contemplated by the Gerruans lias been for some years past a mratter of common knowledge in England; and it lias been also a matter of common opinion that the attempt to execute this plan would involve the active resistance of the British forces, to wliom the duty was supposed to have been assigned of acting on the Ieft tlank of the French opposing tic entiy of the Germans frorn Belgian Territory. THE ARGUMElNT. The argument that Great Britain has taken the aggressive fails to the ground entirely -%vhen it is confronted with the liard facts of chronology. Far froi attacking the Germans, wve -wýere so anxious to keep the peace that we -were actually three danys late in our mobil- ization to join the Frenchi on their left -%ving; and had it xiot been for the defence offered by Liege, our scruples -w'ould have gravely iniperilled the coimnon cause. For it -was not until wc -were certain t.hat, Germany had comimitted what was tantamount to an act of war agaiiist us, by invading tlie neutral state of -Belgium, that we dlhvered t.he. ultimatum that led to the war.",
         "CHRONOLOGICAL SKETCH 0F THE EVENTS THAT LED UP TO THE WAR% The crisis of 1914 began wvith an unforeseen development in the old quarrel of Austria-Hungary and Russia over the Servian question. On June 28 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir-apparent of the Austro-flungari*an monarchy, and his wvife the Duchess of Hohen- berg, paid a -visit of ceremony to the tow%%n of Serajevo, in Bosnia, the administrative centre of the Austrian provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In entering the town the Archduke and the Duchess narrowly escaped being killed by a bomb -which was thrown at their carniage. Later in the day they -%ere shot by assassins armed 'with Browning pistols. The crime -%vas apparently planned by political conspirators w\\ho resented the Austnian annexation of Bosnja and 1-erzegovina and who desired that tiiese provinces should be united to Servia. The Austnian Government, hiaving instituted an inquiry, camne to the conclusion that the bombs of the consp;rators had been obtained from a Servian arsenal, that the crime had been. planned in Belgrade, the Servian c apital. with the help of a Servian staff officer, wvho, pro- vided the pistols; that the criminals and their weapons had been conveycd from Servia into ]3osnia by officers of Servian frontier posts and by Servian customs officiais. At the mn-ient the Austrian Governmnent pul)lishced no proof of these conclusions, but on July 23 forwarded them. to the Servian Governmnent in a formai note containing certain deniands whichi, it was intiniated, mnust be sts factorily answered by Servia withiin forty-eighlt hours. This ulti- nmatum included a. form of apology to be published on a specified date 1wy the Servian Government, and ten engagements which thc eervian Government wvere to give the Austro-Hungarian Govern- nient. . On Juiy 24 thiis note -was cornrnunicated by uti-ngr to the other Powersz of Europe, ami on July 2,5 it wvas publishied in a German paper, the Norddcutsche Ailgemeine Zcitung. It was therefore intended to bc a public warning to Servia.. On JuIy 24 the German Government told the Po-wers that it approved the Alustrian note, as being necessitated ly t.he \"G-reat Servian\", pro- paganda, wvhichi aimed at the incorporation in the Servian monarchy",
         "of the southern Slav provinces belonging to Austria-Hungary; that Austria, if she wished to remain a Great Power, could flot avoid pressing the demands cont.ained in the note, even, if necessary, by mîlitary measures; and that the question wvas one whicli concerned no Powers except Austriti-Hungary and Servia. Russia did not agree that the Austrian note wvas directed against Servia alone. On July 24 the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs told the Britishi Ambassador at St. Petersburg that Austria's conduet was provocative and immoral; that some of hier demands were impos- sible of acceptance; that Austria would neyer have taken such action unless Germany had first been consulted; that if Austria began nmilitary measures against Servia, Russia would probably mobilize. The Russiaii Minister lioped that England would proclaizu its solidar- ity with France and Russia, on the subject of the Austrian note; doubtless Servia wvould accept~ sonie of the Austrian denuands. To the Austro-Ilungarian Goveriment the Ru.ssian Minister sent a message, on thec saine diay, July 24, that the tirne linîit al1owved to Servia for lier reply w'as quite insufficient, if the Powers were tu hielp in smoothing tlie situation; and lie urged that Austria-Hungary shiould publish tlic proofs of the charges against Servia. On July 25 Russia told Eligland that Servia would punisli those proved to 1)e guilty, but would not accept ail the demands of Austria; tliat no independent state could do so. If Servia appealed to arbitration, ams seemed possible, Russia -%vas, she said, prepared to leavre the arbitration in the hiands of England, France, GCrmany and Italy, the four Powers whom Sir Edward Grey liad sug\u0026ested as possible niediators. On the day on wichl Russia inade this suggestion, July 25, the Servian Goverminent replied to the Austrianl note, coxîceding part of the Austrian demiands, and annuuncing its readiniess,, t4o accept, on the other points, the arbitra )tionl of the Hague Tribunal or of the Great Powers. The Austrian Goveriiment found tlie Servian note unsatisfactory, and criticized its details in an officiai menlorandumn. Tlie Austro-Hungarian Minister left Belgrade on July 25; on July 26 a part of the Austro-Hungarian army wvas mobiliz,-d; and oni July 28 AustriaHungary declared war on Servia. Sir Edward Gre2y liad froni the first declined to announce Engiand's solidarity witli Russia and France on the Servian question. On and after July 26 hie wa, taking active steps to, bring. about the merli- ation, between Austria-Hungary and Servia, of four Powers (Italy, Germany, F rance, England). To this mediation Rus,-ia had already 12",
         "agreed JuIy 25; and ]Italy and France were ready to, co-operate with England. Germany, however, made difficulties on the ground that anything like formai intervention would be impracticable, unless both Austria and ]Russia consented to it. Russia had already (JuIy 25) prepared the ukase ordering mobilization, but had not yet issued it; on July 27 the Russian Foreign Minister announced his readiness to inake the Servian qiuestion the subject of direct conversations -with Vienna. This offer was at first declined by the Austro-Hungarian Government, but subsequently accepted; and conversations were actually in progress betw,ýeen the represent- atîves of the two Powers as late as August 1. No doubt the hesitation of Austria was due to the fact that, on July 28, the Russian Government warned Germany of the mobili- ization of the southern military districts of Russia, to be publicly proclaimed on July 29, Austria replied to, this intimation by offering assurances that she would respect the integrity and independence of Servia; these assurances, considered inadequate by the Russian Government, sen to have been the subjcct of the last conversations betwcen Russia and Austria-Hungary. Russia persisted that Germany was the real obstacIe to a friendly settiement; and this conviction wvas not affected by the appeals for peace which t\u003ehe Kaiser telegraphed to the Ts-ar on July 28, July 29 and July 31. On July 29 Gerrnany told England that, the ]Russian mobilization was alarming, and that France was also making military preparations; at the same time Germany threatened to proclaim \"imnminent state of war \"as a counter measure to, the Frencli preparations; German rnilit.ary preparations, by July 30, liad in fact gone far beyond the prcliminary stage which she thus indicat e(]. Germany had already warned England, France and Russia that, if ]Russia rnobilized this would mean German inobilization against both France and Russia. But on July 27, Rusýsia had explained that be-r mobilization would iii nu ýsense be directed against Germany, and would only take placc if Austrian forces crossed the Servian frontier. On July 29 the day on which Russia actually mobilized the southcrn districts, R-ussia once more ask-ed Germany to par- ticipate in the \"quadruple conference\" now proposed by England, for t.he purpose of mediating between usiaand Servia. This proposai was declined by the German Ambassador at St. Peters- burg. Germany in fact bclieved, or professcd to bolieve, that the Russian inobilization, thoughi not procIaimed, wvas already far advanced.",
         "On July 30 Austria, although hier conversations with Russia were stili in progress, began the bomnbardment of Belgrade. The next day July 31, Russia ordered general mobilization; on August 1 France and Germany each took the like step; Germany presented an ultimatum to Russia, demanding that Russian mobilization should cease, and another ultimatum to France asking -what course she would take in the event of -%ar between Germany and Russia. Before these decisi-ve steps of July 30-August 1, and while Sir Edward Grey wva- stili engaged in efforts of mediation, Germany miade overtures to England, with the object of securing England's neutrality in the event of a -var between Germany and France. On July 29 Germany offered, as the price of English neutrality, to give assurances that, if victorious, she would make no territorial acquisitions at th- expense of Firance; but refused to give a simnilar assurance respecting Frenchi colonies, or to promise to respect Belgian neutrality. These proposais were refused by England on July 30. On August 1 the German Amibassador unofficially asked England to remain neutral on condition that Germany would not violate Belgian neutrality. Sir Edward Grey replied that England's hands were stili free, and that lie could not promise neutrality on that condition alone. Meanwhuile, on .July 30, Sir Edward Grey -%vas told by France that she would not remain neutral in a -%ar between Germany and Russia. On July 31 the English Cabinet, bcing asked by France to declare definitely on lier side, replied that England could give no pledge at present. On the samne day England asked France and Germany to engage te respect Belgian neutrality. France assented, Germany evaded giviing a reply. But, on August 2, German forces entered the neutral state of Luxemburg, and England promised to defend the Frenchi coasts and shipping if attacked by the German fleet in the Channel, or throughi the North Sea. On August 4, the King of the Belgians telegraphed to Ring George announcing that Cermany had demanded passage for lier troops through Belgian' territory, and appealing to England for help. On the saille day, August 4, England sent an ultimatum to Germnany asking for assur- ance, before rnidnight, that Germiany -%ould respect Belgian neutral- ity. This demand -was taken at Berlin as equivalent to a declaration of war by England against Germany. 14",

         "AN AID TO UNDERSTAND THE DESPATCHES In reading the despatches froin the Western front most Canadians have been puzzled by reference to the situation in the Champagne, Woevre, Argonne, etc. They look for these names on the map and cannot find them. What theý do find is France divided into a large number of administrative departments, namned mostly after rivers such as Marne, Meuse, Meuse et Moselle, Aisne and so forth. Sometimes these departments are referred to in describing operations, but not often. The names that are used are those of the twelve inilitary sectors into which the allied line bas been divided from Switzeriand to the North Sea. As they are in most cases the ancient designations of the various districts Frenchmen appreciate their significance, but flot the outsider. The first of these sectors is that in which Canadians have the 'greate-st personal interest. i. Flanders: Comprising the country in Belgiuin from the sea to a littie belowv Ypre-s. 2 . .Artois: With Arras lying1 near its centre. 3. Picardy: With Amiens as the centre. 4. Santerre: Which comprises the region froin Roye to thie south- ward ztnd whichi embraces the Valley of the Oise. .5. Soissonaise: Comiprising thie region including Soissonl and which extends pract-ically up to Rheims. 6. Champagne: Extendingr from Rheims to beyond Chalonsý. 7. Argonne: So named byv reason of the forest of Argonne, definingy practically ail of this region. S. Hautes de Meuse: Withi Verdun as its centre. 9. Woevre: The region hetween the hcadwaters of the Meuse and the Moselle river. 10. Lorraine: The region bordering on former French Lorraine. il. Vosges: So called by rezioil of including the mountaini range of that name. 12. Alsace: Comprising the frontier region bct.ween Firenri. and Giernian Alsace. If the positions of these sectors are untderstood, it. vill enable one to follow mnuch more intelligently the officiai statements of the Paris War Office.",
         "WAR TERMS WHICH ARE USED IN DESPATCHES FROM THE FRONT Abattis, Entanglements and Redoubts. See Entrenchments. Advance Guard: A smaller body of troops mnoving in front of the marching coluinn to e-xplore the ground and prevent surprise. Every body of troops, small. or large, in war time bas an advanced guard. In the case of armies or armny corps, the advanced gutard will be a force of ail arms, strong enough to hold its own against an attack until the army behind it can deploy from its marching columnus into battie array. The termn \"Strategie Advance Guard\" is used by modern French -writers on war in a special sense. It means a large force, perhaps amouiiting to several armny corps, -whose mission is to gain touch with the encemy and hold him in position, -while the main body known as the \"masse de manoeuvre\" pivots upon it, and strikes at, one or the other of the encnmy's flankzs. Army: This word is u.sed in three different senses (1) the whole organized land force of a nation; (2) tlhe whole fc'-cc engaged in a theatre of wvar; (3) a nuniber of arnxy corps grotiped under one comnmande~r as suihordinate unit ini this army of oprains las in the Franc-o- Germian War there were, on the Germnan side, the Lst, 2-nd, and 3rd arnesan lte te tharY, rAn fte?1ue On the Frenrh side, thue. Arnuy of the Rhine, the Arnuyv of Chalons, or reserve army, and later the Army of the North, Arny of the Loire, etc. Armistice: A suspension (f hiostilit.ies,, eithcr lorally or generally, by mnutual agreement. Army Corps: The largest organized unit in an armny. It is mnade up of from t-wo to threc infantrv divisions,, with a certain proportion of art-illery, eaarengineers, and various aux.iliary services (transport, ainununi- tlou. columns, amnbulances, etc.). It is a littie army compîcte in itsel1f, and its strengthi is deterniined kv tak-ing the average number of men thiat cun move on a single rond, and cover only surc a length that in a single day it can close up and formn for battie to the front.",
         "The strength arid organization varies in different armies. In the British ariny it is made up of two infantry divisions, each of tbree brigades of four battalions, seventy guns, a small cavalry detacli- ment, and Royal Engineers, field and telegraph companies, ammuni- tion and supply columns and ambulances. Besides these divisional troops, the corps commander generally has at his disposai some additional batteries of he.wvy artillery, telegraph and bridging detach- ments of engineers, a drc.achmnent of the Flying Corps, and infantry battalion to îerve as an escort to headquarters, and a mounted detachinent for IneSSenger duties. A German Army Corps has two divisions each of t.,wo brigades of six battalions, an artillery force mnade up of as many batteries as there are battalions in each division, t.wo caValry regiments, and attac.hed to the corps heavy batteries, engineer troops, and supply coluinns. Armay Service Corps: The na.me in our armny for the troops org,,anized to conduct the supply and transport work of t.he army. Arbillery: A word used for (1) the cannon of an army, with their draught horses and the ofilcers and men who handie them; (2) the guns ilhemseives. The artillery wnit.h the British army is made up of lwo kinds of field guns-the 18 pounder quic-k-firer gun that. worlks w.ith the infantry and has; its detacliment of gunners conveyed on ilie seats of the linîber and on seats on the axie of the gun, and lighlter 13 pounder quick-firer of the horse artillery batteries. The gunners for flie 13 pounder are mounted on hor.,es-. Ail field and lior.se artillery guns are dra-%vn by te.ars of six horses in three couples, vn~ch couple ha.ving a driver mountedl on the near horse. Thic tcam. is harne.-sed to a limber, a heavv two-Nvheeled carniage with two innnunit.ion boxes on top of it. A ring or eye, on the end of the trail of the gun-thbat i-z, the iron tuibe at the back wvhichi, with the wheels, supports i. whcn it is in position-is hitched on to a hook on the liniher when the gun is on the miove. The gun is not directly at. tached to its carrnage, but is rnounted so, as to slide freely back- wards and forwards in a frame or cradie pivoted on the a-Xle-tree ani f rail. Above the gun is fixed a device which, controls the recoil, and as the gu.i bl-,ides back aftcr being fired, compresses powerful springs whichl bring it back imnrdiatcly to the original position. This enables the gun to bc fired rapidly again and âagain wçithounit tnking aim, as once properly laid on the mark the recoil spnings",
         "bring it back to its original position after firing. The gunners are protccted by a steel shield, and the gun has telescopie siglits. Other guns are the 4-5 quick-flring field howitzer, throwing a 38 pound sheli. The howitzer is a shorter gun with a larger bore, fircd at a high angle of elevation, so as to drop the sheil in a curved flight over entrenchments and other obstacles. Field artillery ranges up froin 6,000 to 8,000 yards. Eachi British division lias a battery of heavy guns of stili longer range, long 6O pounders drawn by tearns of eiglit, heavy draughit horses, and throwing their big shelis to a distance of 10,000 yards. Artiery Brigade: In our ariny a group of three batteries commanded by a colonel. Automatie Rifle: A rifle that re-loads itself automatically by the force of the recoil or the gas produced by the discharge. It. is fired from the shloulder, whereas; the machine gun is used on a liglit carrnage or tripod. The enemy are said to be arming snipers withi automatic riflez- Asphyxiating Gas: Chlonine, a heavy yellov. gaz, intensely poisonous. discharged fromn steel cylinders in -which it has been compressed. Base or Base of Supply or Base of Operations: The district from which an army dra-ws its supplies, etc., and where the lines of communication originate. Advanced Base: Usually the place ivhere supply by rail cornes to an end, and the w'ork is taken up b:y road transport. Here large depots are formned as a resqerve. Battalion: A unit of infantry, usuallýy 1,000 strong, and divided into four companies, each of 250. Battery: (1) A. number of guns placed iii a position to attack an enciny; (2) a unit of art.illery generally coresisting of 'six (or in the French Army four) guns.",
         "Bivouac 1 Troops spending the night or a longer period in the open w ithout, tents are said to be in bivouac. Brigade: In the British Army, for the infantry, has a strengtlh of 47000; in the German and most continental armies, of 6,000. Brigadier- General: The commander of an infantry or cavalry brigade. In our army this is a teml)orary rank, held ly a colonel or lieutenant-colonel while commanding a brigade. (It may be wvorth noting that in the French army a \"brigadier\" is a non-commissioned officer below the rank of sergeant.) Baitie-Plane: A large aeroplane carrying a gun armament (generaily a machine gun, but oc.casionally a smail piece of artillery). Bridge-Head: A fortifled -%ork protecting the end of a bridge. AU the Germnan bridges over the B.hine are defended by very strong works of this character on the westerni bank. Camp: An assemblage of tents or huts -or troops halted. Not used in modern w'ar in Ev-ope uniess the hlt is a proionged one, as the conveyance of tents adds greatly to the transport train. Cautonnient: Troops which, when halted are lodged in the houses of towns and village.s. are said to be in cantonments. Cavalry: The mounted troops of an armiy empioycd for (1) scouting and reconnoitering on its front and flanks; (2) action in battie, either riîouinted in the charge, or dismounted with carbine-s or rifles. Former- ly only dragoons were uscd. for dismounted action, and such -were mounted on horses not trained for the chiarge. Now cavalry of ail kinds are trained bothi for miounted and dismounted action. The various kinds of cavalry are (1) heavy cavalry -cuirassiers and dragoons, originally big men on hcavy horses employed oniy for charg- ing. In our ariny the cuirass is worn by the Househoid Cavalry",
         "only- in peace for parade and ceremonial purposes. At manoeuvres or in war, they -wear neither cuirass nor helmet; but in many foreign armies armour stili survives in the cuirassier regiments on active service. (2) Lancers were only introduced into aur army after the Waterloo Cainpaign, and into the Frenchi Army by Napoleon, when lie added a number of Polish regiments ta the Grand Army. There are now lancer regiments in ail European armies. In the German army they are kno-wn as Uhlans, the Polish word for a lancer. (3) Liglit cavalry are generally known as Hussars, and wear a uniform which is derived from the dress of the Hungarian mounted levies, just as the dress of our Lancers is a modification of the oid Polish costume. (4) In the Frenchi army there are a number of regiments of Chasseurs a Cheval, or mounted rifies-originally raised, like our mounted infantry, for action on foot, the horse being intended only to, bring them rapidly to the scene of the fighting. They are now practically like cavalry. Mounted infantry bas lately been abolished in our army. But one may say that we stili have mounted infantry in the Territorial cyclist battalions, whieh use the cycle ws the horse wvas formerly used. Commissariat: The army department that looks after supplies of food and forage. The name cornes from. the former titie of its officers, wbio used ta be callcd comimissariats for supply. Cadre: A nucleus of trained officers, sergeants and corporals which in war may be expanded into a regirnent of infiantry or a force of artillcry. Calibre: Bore or diarneter of a gun or shell. Thus a \" 75 \" a gun of 75 millirneters bore (firing shelis of that diameter) or about 3 inches. Corps: An army corps is a body of troops, infantry, artiilery and cavalry, usually numbcring froi 35,000 ta 50,000 men, with 110 to 1.50 guns. Chasseur: A rifleman or liglit infantryman. Company: One-fourth of a battlion of Infantry, or 240 ta 250 men.",
         "Cuirassiers: See Cavalry. To Consolidate a Position: To re-arrange the defenses of a captured position, place fresh barbed-wired entanglements about if,, and alter it so that it can be held against a counter-attaec. Cupola: A turret with armour containing a gun or machine gun. Curtain of Fire: Is when a large number of guns so direct their sheils as to cut off the enemy's approach or retreat by a lime of shelis descending steadily in his front or rear. A Curtain of Shelis is generally uised in the attack on the first-line trenches to prevent thc arrivai of supports. Defile: In ordinary colloquial language means a narrow pass in hlis or broken ground. In niilitary language, it is applied to any ground where it is impossible to march on a broad front and troops are forced in a narrow column. Thus, a road running betwecn two marshes, where the troops upon it cannot leave tho road and form line, wvould be described as a defle. Deploy: To form from a narrow onto a broader front, e.g., to form marching column into line. Dragoons: Sec Cavalry. Division: A smaller body of troops than an army corps, usually containing infan-ry and artillery with a strength of about 18,000, Dugout: A shelter in the trenches below the level of the earth, out of which it is dug. Men take refuge in it during a bombardment and live in it when not required for the defense of the trenches.",
         "Echelon: Body of troops are said to on echelon when they occupy positions behind or in advance of the other flank, just as the black or white squares follow each other diagonally across a chess board. Enfilade: Fire of musketry or artillery not coming from the front, but from a flank, so as to take the line from end to end. Thus the saine projectile may bring down more than one man, or, missing one, is likely to strike others. It is the most deadly kind of fire. As a protection against it, trenches are given a zigzag or broken outline, and at various points obstacles are placed to break the line. These protections against enfilade fire are known as traverses. Emplacement: A position usually in the trenches, or separately entrenched, for a gun or machine gun. Entrenchments: Temporary fortifications, formed chiefly by digging in the ground. They are made up chiefly of (1) trenches for infantry, formed either by digging a deep trench and making the unbroken ground in front a protection against hostile fire, or throwing up the earth to make a low mound with a hollow behind it for the men, the fresh earth being concealed with sods, branches, etc. (2) Gun-pits constructed in the same way, but large enough to give shelter to field artillery and howitzers. (3) Redoubts-that is, small completely or partly closed forts formed by digging a ditch and throwing the earth outwards to make a low rampart. An older form of obstacle is the abbates, formed by felling trees and bushes, and fastening them together with their branches towards the eneiny. Fascines: Faggots or bundles of sticks bound together and used for con- structing earthworks, building saps and filling ditches or obstacles. Fuse: The mechanism by which shells are exploded. A percussion fuse detonates the shell when the nose strikes the ground, the shock firing a cap in the fuse and the fiame travelling to the charge in the shell. A time fuse detonates the shell a certain number of seconds or fractions of a second after the shell has left the gun. The shock",
         "of firing is made to igiiite a slow-burning composition iii Mie fuse; after a certain time, wvhieh can be varied accordinig as a screw in the nose of the sheil is set by the gunners, the fiame in the composition reaches the charge in the sheli and explodes it. Many shelis and shrapnel have both a time and percussion fuse. Glacis: The smooth slope outside a line of trenches for fortification, whviceh is cleared, as far as possible of ail shelter for the enemny, so as to give a good field of fire from the trenches or fortifications. Grenades: Bombs or small'4projccti1es thrown by hand, containing high explosives-, -%vlich is fired.either by a tiine or percussion fuse. Howitzer: Sec Artillery. jHussars: Sec Cavalry. High Explosive: Explosive of greater power than those used in guns for propelling projectiles. The best known are Lyddite and ïMelinite, both of which are made by treating carbolie acid -%vithi nitrie acid; and trinitrotoluol, :made by treating toluol, whviceh is obtained from coal in the manufacture of coke or gas, with nitrie aeid. High Explosive Shell: A sheil with thick steel walls containing a charge of highi explosive, such as lyddite, melinite or trinitrotoluol. The explosive is very violent, shattering the sheil into many pieces and debtroying every- tignear. 0f use ag-ainst buildings and fortifications. Lancers: Sec Cavalry. Limber: Sec Artillery. Line oxe Communications: The series of railway lines and roads by whie.h. an arrny in the. field receives its supplies of food, ammunition, etc., and its rein- forcements, and sends away its sick and wounded. The large",
         "armies of today cannot lix e on local supplies, and the line of communi- cations may irclude waterways, such as rivers and canais. In the case of an oversea expedition, the sea itself may be part of it and in that case naval protection of the line of supply is ail important. Lachrymatory Sheils: A type of sheli wrhich on bursting blinds those near it whom, it does not kili. Lazaret: A hospital. Left bank of a River: Is to the left coming- down stream fromi the source to the sea. Lift: A technical artillery term meaning to raise the angle of the guns firing so as to tlirow the shelîs farther away. Thus during an attack thie gunis sheil the enemy's trenches; -when the storming line reaches the trenches the guns lift or throw their projectiles farther back, to avoid killingr their own men and prevent the approacli of enemy reinforcements. Listening Post: A post, as near as possible to the enemy's lines, in advance of the trenches, where men are stationed at niglit to guard against surprise, and, if possible, hear what the enemy is doing. Machline Gun: A gun which fires rifle ammunition automatically, the recoil or gas produced by each discharge mechanically reloading the gun and discharging it if the trigger is held back. A good machine gun can fire 600 rounds a minute. Masse de Manoeuvre. Sce Advanced Guard. Mixed Brigade: A small mixed force of infantry, cavalry, and guns assembled for a special purpose. Mine Gallery: Is a tunnel under the ground leading to a mine or serie.s of mines. Each of these mines, when a serious attack is being made on an enemy's position rnay contain a ton or more of high explosive.",
         "Mortax: A very short gun for high-angle fire, generally flot rifled, and thus differing from a howitzer. Minenuerfer or French Mortar: A small smooth-borc gun for throwing a large sheli a very short distance, used in trench fighting. Outpost: A Uine of detachments placed in front of and on the flanks of a halted force, in order, (1) to prevent it being attacked before it lias timne to fori for action; (2) t(-o keep a constant watch upon thle grouxîd to the front. An outpost line is generally formed of piekets, which are small bodies of troops that keep sentries; posted and patrols in movement to observe the ground in front, and have other detachments known as supports and reserves in their immediate rear. (in American military writings and reports pickets are sentries, and the picket line is thc sentry lino.) Outflank: To get around thec extremity of a line of troops so as to attack them by enfilading fire and threatening their rear. Picket: See Outposts. Platoon: One-fourth of a conipany of infantry or sixty men. Pontoon: A kind of large punt or flat-bottorned boat conveyed in a carniage, and used to make floatirig bridges. Parapet: A breastwork protecting troops. Park: In technical military language means a collection of wheeled vehiclcs-guns, wagons or motor cars.",
         "Pioneers: Troops who remove obstacles, clear roads, dig trenches and construet camps or entanglements. In the British Armny this work is usually carried out by the engineers, though pioncer battalions have been raised in this war. Point o' Appui: A fortifled position of special strength in a line of trenches or defences, such as a stout building loop-holed and strengthened with concrete. Quick-firing Guns: Breach-.loading artillery so mountcd that, when the gun is fired, the recoil, instead of driving the carniage backwards, sends the gun itself sliding back between the guides of a cradie or trough fixed on the carrnage, this recoil movement beingr controlled by hydrau- lic brakes and coiling powerful spnings, which bring the gun back automatically to the firing position. Thus the gun lias not to be relaid after each shot, but can be kept on its target and fired again and again as quickly as it is reloaded. Regiment: 0f infantry usually consists of three or four battalions, or 3,000 or 4,000 men; of cavalry usually consists of three or four squadrons. Redoubt: An earthwork which is completely enclosed, such as the Hohen- zollern redoubt on Hill 70. This is almost square and can resist attack from the rear. Such earthworks are surrounded with elabor- ate entanglements of barbed wire and generally contain armored shelters, mounting machine guns, and dug-outs or bomb-proofs to give shelter duning a bombardment. Re-Entrant: Is an angle in a position the point or apex of which is directed inwards towards the interior of the position. Ricochet: When a sheli or bullet glances or rebounds it is said to ricochet. Sap: Is a trench running out towards the enemy's position. It usually shows on the map as a zigzag, the objeet of zigzagging being to,",
         "prevent the enemy frorn sweeping or enfflading it -%vith fire, as lie certainly would if it were carried straight onit toward him. The work of carrying out a sap is one of the rnost hazardous iii which troops can engage. Sap Head: The end or termination toward the enerny of such a sap. Salient: Ils an angle in a position the point or apex of which juts ont froni the position. A salient is difficuit to hold because it wvill usuaUvy be swept by a cross-fire. Sector: A position of a fr-ont; strictly speaking that part of a circle wvhichi is boulnded by t'wo radii and the part of the circuinference between thein. Traverses: See Enfilade. Trestie Bridge: An improvised rnilitary bridge, made by lashing or bolting together wooden bearns into tresties which serve as piers, and carryng the roadway across on these. r Tamp: rfo beat down the earth upon a charge of explosive in a liole or tunnel. If a charge is not tarnpe1 muchi of its force is lost through passing out by the hole or tunnel. Trench; First Line: Ils the outermost line of trenches in the position defended. The trench rnay be a shallow excavation in the earth Nvith the soil rernoved thrown in front, so as to shielter men lying( clown against rifle fire, or an elaborate work, excavated deeply, with protection for the heads of the men firing, knowni as headoover. In inany of the Cermanl trenches concrete and steel armor are ernployed to give security against shelis. Trench; Second Line: Ils an inner series of trenches where supports are usually kept, or bodies of men ready to go to the aid of the mexi in the first-line trench when the enemy attacks.",
         "Trench; Third Lino: Are the ininost series of trenches, as usually t.here are not more than three distinct lines in the defences of any position or front. The German third-line trenches on the British and French front are reported to be of immense strength. Trench Communication: A line of earthworks or a tunnel or passage in the earth by which the first, second or third-line trenches are reached, and which gives men moving along it shelter against hostile fire. Trench-Mortar: See IMortar. Unit: An organized rnilitary force of a certain size, as a platoon (60), a company (240), a battalion (1,000) men, etc. Uhians: See Cavalry.
