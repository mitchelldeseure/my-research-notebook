Through weary years and 'neath the changing skies, Mena turned their back on those appealing Eyes And scorned as vain Thine awful Sacrifice. Kings with their armies, children in their play, Have passed unheeding down this shell-ploughed way, The great world knew not where its true stiength lay.

At last, O Christ, in this strange, darkened land, Where ruined homes lie round on every hand, Life's deeper truths men corne to understand. For lonely graves along the country side, Where sleep those brave hearts who for others died Tell of life's union with the Crucified. And new light kindies in the mourner's eyes, Like day-dawn breaking, througli the rifted skies, For Life is born of life's self-sacrifice. SAILLY, FRANCE. 1915.",

This boy had visions while in life 0f stars on distant skies; So death came in the midst of strife A sudden, glad surprise.",
