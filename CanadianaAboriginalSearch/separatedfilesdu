COOKE it is flot enougli for us to send men and guns. and then wait with national cock- sureness for the resuit. We must econonlize, and be ready if the call should cone to send money and money and more money. W'e muust do this if we are Io reap the benefit when the war is over. Mr. Cooke bas just returned front England. He was at the front. Ile was in the trenches. But what he saw there did flot impress him so much as the conditions lie observed in Great Britain. He found sometbing behind the grim, determined expression on the countenance of John Bull. If we are indifferent, we should read this article. If we are in doubt, we should read it.

Langton of the University of Toronto. ÎL*ýNNOUTNCEMENTS of this new Series, TifE CHrRONIcLEs OF CANADA, were fiirst sent out in July, 1914. Twelve volumes of the Series had just been published. The Series met with instant recognition. Orders for it began to pour in by mail, by telephone, and even by tele- graph, increasing as the autumn wore on. The publishers hadl printed an edition large enough, they thouglit, to last for two Years; but so insistent wvas the demand that it was necessary to print a second edition within six months. Since then ten new volumes have been published and the remamn- inIg ten have passed the editorial censors and into the hands of the printers. Meanwhile subseribers for the Series have multiplied and are multiplying increasinglv Readers wvho have neyer read history before are reading these volumes. Not since the day of Macaulay lias any new work of sober history found so many readers in so short a time. Because the narratives are simple, clear, strong, pictorial, and 'Vivid.

         "The Best Ilistory of Canada \"The great menit of the Chronicles is that they unito good history and good reading. TheY are accurate and truthful, and can bear coin- parisan in their style of writing with the mos,t înteresting volumnes of history ever written, - Marjory MacMurchy, in The Toronte Daily News. Because the Series unfolds the history of Canada as a story of wonderful power, abounding in dramatie action and human interest. It begins as a vivid epic of the sea and the forest, and marches through the centuries with a pageant of sailors, explorers, black-robed priests, painted savages, fur-hunters, rovers of the wilderness, voy- ageurs, seigneurs, traders, soldiers of the Lily and of the Rose. Âno n, the blazing brilliancy of the Chateau St. Louis, with glint of shining. rapier and shimmer of satin doublet, gîves place to a grim tragedy of starvation on some desolate shore of the North. Explorers with their reti nues paddle and portage from lake to la-ke, build forts, camp with redskins, and grow mnto the fur-elad majesty of men who have fought the primi- tive forces of nature. Everywhere present are the black-robed soldiers of the Cross, everywhere are Red Indians; and over ail hangs the shadow of the \"irrepressible con- fict\" betwcen France and England. The scene changes and other char- acters appear. Out of lonely cabins in the heart of the forest-thc homes of exiles-new forces arise in the land; and Canada enters upon an era of political struggle and change. The far-flung pro- vinces urnte and bring f orth the Dominion. Then comne the steel- highway builders and the migra- tion of peoples towards the settingy Sun. Later, cornes the tramp of Canada's sons, marching in the Great War. A mighty nation is making. ARRANGEMENT Sc the annexed list of tities. The Series is arranged in nine groups and comprises thirty-two complete narratives or volumes. These advance connectedly, f rom phase to phase, through period after period, over the four hun- dred years of Canadian adventure and progrcss from the earliest ex- plorers to the Captains of our own time.

ILLUSTRATIONS AND MAPSI The Series contains two hun- dred and sixteen historical pic- tures, of which thirty-six are re- produced in colours. These in- clude a score of paintings fromn the brush of the celebrated illus- trator, C. W. Jefferys. There are also fort.y-six maps, expressly drawn and engraved for the work, by Bartholomew, to make per- fectly clear the geographical set- ting of the narratives, to show such things as the movemient of troops in battle, the situation of settlements and forts, the poli- tical divisions of the country, and the routes of exploreirs. INDEXES It is customary to publish short books for popular reading without taking the trouble to index them. But this is un- donbtedly a serions error. Nothing is more annoying than to be compelled to sean perhaps a hundred pages in order to find something which a good index wonld point ont instantly. Every volume of THE CisOeNICLES OF CANADA is care- fnlly and thoroughly indexed. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES The author of a volume of THE CITRONICLES 0F CANADA must, Of course, be familiar with a wide range of literature on the sub- ject. This may be in the formi of printed books, or it may be documentary material or files of old newspapers. A list of the principal books and other sources from. which the author has drawn his facts, with such comment on each as he deems necessary, is printed at the end of the volume and handed on to the reader; so that if he wishes to read more hie may collect the books or consult them. at a public library. FORMAT The volumes are pocket si7e, seven inclies by five, and less than an inch thick. The whole set wîll occupy only about twenty-eight juches of the sheif. The type, the paper, and the binding are in1 aceordance with the best examples of modern book-making, and the volumes have those qualities'of distinction, in lightness, flexibility, and elegance, which betoken the care of the craftsman.

The serial tales, \"The Independence of Claire,\" \"Bettina,\" \"The Brown Study\" and the many prac- tical articles on ~Z crochet, knitting, fashions dress- making, h ou se- keeping and the like, ahl maintain the usual hlgh standard. Articles on war subjects are flot wanting, and throughout an excellent sense of Proportion has been c a r e f u y maintained. The numnerous illus- trations are, as always, a speciai feature of the volume. The companion volume,, TXE EOYB' O'W2 ANNUAÀL, is equally stisfactory in its, successful caterüng for its many boy readers, and the editor bas succeeded as usual in enlistlng the help of many Popýular contributors. Pive serial stories, ,ne]luding one by Jules Verne, provide amnpl e excitement and adventure.

In a Mutual Company there are no dividends 0 payable on stock, and the policyholders' divi- dends are by so mucli increas ed. 8 Moreover, the profits are large because the investments of the Company have always been safe and remunerative. Not one dollar has ever been lost in speculation, while the intereat earned lias been high. Again, The 14utual can give maximum protection at minimum cost because the operating expenses are as low as is consistent with efficiency. Every economy ha. been studied; for example, the location of the Head Office f avors moderate expenses for administration. A fourth reason why our profits are large and the cost of insurance correspondingly low is that the policyholders are carefully chosen. Our death losses are fewer than were assumed in calculating the premiums, The resuit is a surplus that speils lower premiums or increased protection. The Mutual Life of. Canada Waterloo, Ontario",

What newspaper art may laek ln iu- spiration it more than makes up by watY of perspiration.

Mayhap the publie would be duly grateful for being spared, if it knew, but it does flot know, and in most cases the directors and sharehoiders of the paper do not know, and it ie the latter phase of the situation which causes the artist sonietimes to wonder how mucli long'er lie wil] be paid coin of the reain for making drawings for the eerap heap. Artiste at large may speciahize. The lover of outdoor life niay paint landscapes to his heart's content, and the portrait artist may portray so long as he can find somneone willing te pay for the privilege of having bis face transferred to canvas. But the niewspaper artist must with few exceptions be a jack-of-all-art. H1e must be designer, cartooniet, iMus- trator, map-maker, x-marks-the-spot- ter, and photo-retoucher or l'spot- knoeker\u003e ail in one. With the pos- sible exception of the matter of brains, editors as a rule regard art- iste as being supernatural creatures who should be able off-handedly and without references of any kind to draw anything and everything that the almost fiendish ingenuity of the editorial mind cau coneive. Can't and impossible are two worde that will neyer flnd a place in the news- paper artist's voeabuiary so long as editors have any opinion. Even the most calions critie must admit that if there îe nothing other than variety in newspaper art there îs plenty of that. Oue minute the newspaper artist is drawing a cartoon showing Young Canada being forced to walk the piank of uselese expendi- tures by a piratical band of goveru- ment contractors for war supplies, aud the next minute he ie ont mak- ingz a hurry-call sketch of a lire scene while a etream, of water from an over- hanging roof trickies down hie neek. .If, ïn his unholy baste, the artist has unwittingly pîetured tbree hairs on a pote whicb forment, sported but two, let there bc no waîlîng and gnashîog of teetk.' Photo-retouching ie perliaps the most despised phase of his art, aud Yet it je an art of itself-after a fa- shion. Given hie choice of a good photo and a bad one the average re- porter will (so ail newspaper artiste; swear) always select the bad one. So it is that ahaost always before it eau be reproduccd in the paper.the -photo must go through an extensive opera- tion. Putting a daub of Chinese white here aud a dauli of proces black or opaque there looke like a simple procees. Equally simple in appearance je the process of repise- iug au eye which bas been obliterated perhape by a scaiding tear from. the eye of a fond relative. But let it be remembered that when the photo. graph appears in haif-tone form, it muet resemble at least in sorne remote way a human being, and if there etili remains a faxnily resembiauce to the partieular 4umian being whose like- nees bas been so repaired ail the bet- ter. Therein contes the art. If, iu hie unholy haste, the artist bas un- wîttingly pietured three haire on a pate which formeriy sported but two, let there be no wailing and gnashing of teeth. Those who dauce muet pay the fiddier, and he who trusts his photo to the tender, but hurried merdies of a newspaper artist muet be prepared for the worst.

Thus the map may serve a triple purpose, in that it gratifies the curiosity of editor and publie, besides being a means of misleading and dis- eoncerting tlie Germans. Perhaps not tlie least important phase of the newspaper artist's work is that of court sketching. It ils diffi- cuIt work, and it is thankless work. If, after ovcrcommng the various dis- advantages under whiei lie labours, the artist succeeds in securing a flair- ly gond likeness of the subject of the sketch he lias done no more than was expected of hîm.

Cartier, writing te thec King, bursts out into panegyric on \"the goodne-ss and fertility of the western lands.\" and on \"the fruitful- ness of the great river which fiewav and waters these your lands, which is the greatest without comparison that is known to have ever been seen.» Cartier had corne out te spend the winter in Canada to take pseion of it for the King of France, and wbile he went on up to Hlochelaga, whieh lie named Mont Royal. he left \"imasters and mariniers» te \"make a fort before the ships all inclosed with large sticks ot timber\" at Stadacona (Quebee) '\u003cwhich is as good land as it may be possible te behold, and very 119 frl'Ilt fi ut, fi I of xedn fai r fres.

(How great neither of thein know 1) But on the approacli of winter, the, ships of the huec had to wvithdraw to Halifax; the Frenchi stili bield Montreal, and it was ex- pected that during tiie winter they would attempt to retake the citadel. Tt looked fis if they miglit suceceed. Only 7,000 Britishi troops had been left at Quebee-as niany ondy as could be ted. By Chiristmas, only 4,359 were fit for duty. As in Cartier's expedition the winter sickness proved ton mucli for the. medical and sani- tary knowledge ot the. tiiu.s. Wolte's sueemaful army 'had marciied into \"the ruins of a town\".

But Christmas passed witiiout the. attaek being made, and spring saw the su- pr.macy of England ev.rywiiere It seems an extraordinary circuxu- stance that the next epocli in Can- adian history should again be marked by a 8eige ot Quebee. But it is su. These three victories-of Frenchi against Indian, of Englishi against Frenchi, of B3ritish against Americsu -determined the racial and national characteristics ot ail Canada. This third Christmas, of 1775, was a third time of anxious watching and wait- ing at Quiebec. ARl over the American continent, the Amerieanis were successful, Cuuld Carleton hold Quebee for England against Montgomery? Bach had about 1.,500) effective men. Montgomery iiad made an amazingly succesaful march over the Height of Land frorn New England aud arrived before Quebec on Nokvember l3th. He ex- peeted aid froxu within the town, thougli the French, being satisfl.d with Carleton's humane goverumnent, iiad not risen tu his support as lie had thoutglt they would. On the twenty-second of Decemaber a deserter from tie Amnerican camp informed the Britishi General that an attack would b. made on the twenty-tiiird. That day, Christmas Ev. and Christ- mas Day were passed in expectation ot the. attack, whieh being made fin- ally on the, thirtieth, resulted ini the defeat ut General Montgomery aud the. subsequent withdrawal of the Re- volutiouary forces.

The original records of the case, difflenit to decipher, it is truc, both froin age and froin the style of writing, are readily accessible in the Archives of the Mýontreal Court Flouse. The crime in question, to borrow Maeaulay's phraseology, is \"memorable for its singular atrocity, mienuorable for the tremnendous retribution by whicli it was followed,\" and has for us now considerable historical interest.

A search of B3e- lisle's biouse was ordercd Wo procure evidence.

It was the two boys wlio push- ed the baby-carniage. I kncw froin their trousers. They were not neatly eut, like mnany of the boiys' trousers froin other streets. And tltey liad not been bouglit ready-made. The strong liands of the little mother, who carrîed chairs and slats from the bed, werc responsible for them. And the fathter, who lîad gone off to work before the sun peeped around the corner of thc fine hall, had worn both pairs of trousers before. But they did not look the samne wheu lie wore them. For thene were not two pairs then. Only one. Still, the boys were happy, and did flot mind telling their conipanioins that their trousers-one pair at Ieast -had real pockets, and titat daddy had worn theni before. Indeed, they were rather proud of it. flown the street a fcw blocks, I noticed several woinen hanging out their washings. A bit of rope was stretched from one back porcli to the next. It was on this tliat the wvash- ings were hung. Now, the neighibourhood of the littie street is rather grimay. That is, there are a great many factories around therc. A soap factory and a tannery, and several blacksmith, shops. Of course, titis makes the back yards dirty. For smoke- and ciii- ders pour out of the great chimneys. And the washings are often just as grimy when they are taken down fri the lines as before they were hung out. And many of the shirts have big holes in thein. Stili, the woîncn would never dreain of hanging thcm in the attie. A bit of poor air is better titan noue. And\u0026 anyhow, thc attie is insed as a sleep- ing-room every night.

One may be allowed to repeat here what was written more than thirte years ago: «Withont going beyond our own country, we have the fact that at the t-ime of the Union of the Provinces there was in operation lu Nova Scotia a law under which the active militia, for whom the Govertmuent undertook to furnish rifles and artiilery, includ- ed the wbole male population between the ages of sixieen and forty-llve, while the reserve included all men between forty-five and sixty. If this had been continued, there woffld now (1915) be as many active militia in Nova Scotia as there are iu the whole Dominion. -Ail the mi- litiamen were enrofled, aud those of the first class, the active militia, were drilled for five days every year. The offlcers were obliged to undergo a fairly long course o? instruction aud to pass examinations on their duties; and the men were drilled by sergeauts qualifled as ingtruletors. Substantial- ]y, the active militia were not inferior to the present comparatively amall force known by the same name. The privates did not, as a rule, wear ur forms; and, with the exception o? t] headquarters' staff, the adjutants ar the drill sergeants, noue of the for, were directly paid. The yearly trai ing was not looked upon as a burd( or a grievance. Iu fact, it was r garded rather lu the light of an a\u0026 nual picnic. It appears from the r turus of 1867 that the total ntumb, of men enroiled in the active milit lu 1866 was over 58,000, o? who 45,767 were actually drilled, while ti cost o? the militia for the last ineý tioued year was $114,460, o? whi( amount $36,561 was of an extraordi ary character, arising out o? t] \"Fenian Scare,\" s0 called. This ti fliug expenditure covered besid small grants lu aid of the volunteer who were required to undergo twel, days' drill lu each year, to wear ur f orm, aud to put iu a certain amoni of target practice, and who number( in 1866 something over eleven hwx dred. The total expeuditure ou thec mi] tia in Nova Scotia under the svste in operation at the time of the Uuic was cousiderahly lcss than two dc lars for each man actually drilled, than a dollar aud a haif for each xnE enrolled in the active class. Thei figures seem absurdly emall to 1 now; buit they are taken from t] public accounts o? the Province ar from the report o? the Adjutami (leneral, which also shows as alreaè stated that about oue-sixth o? ti whole population wus enrolled ar. that nearly one-seventh actuail Ir derweut military training.

         "THE CANADIAN MAGAZINE adian Mfaqazine for Jannary, 1902, a sketch was given of the military systein in operation in Nova Scotîa at the turne of the Union of the Pro- vinces; and the opinion was expressed that that systei or a modification of it could with great advantage be ap- plied to the Dominion of to-day. Credit for the excellence of the Nova Scotia systein was given to Lieutenant- Colonel R. Bligli Sinclair, the Adjutant-General of Militia for the Province in those days. The whole trath was not, however, told about that able, painstaking and de- voted public servant. Before the date of the Union, lie submitted to the Lientenant-Governor a, \"Report on advancing the State of the Nova Scotia Militia by a New Classifica- tion,\" whicli embodied an improved seheme for the organization of the provincial defence forces. The Re- port bears date the 19th of Oetober, 1866, and will be fonnd i the Third Appendix to the Journals of the House of Assembly for 1867. It shows that the Adjutant-General had made himlncf familiar with the Ger- man and Swiss systeins and with that i operation in the Channel Islands, and explains has \"deuign to divide thec Local Forces into: First Men for effective traiing, First Service Mien, and Successive reserves, with gradu- ated, lessening training and duty in peace.» Thei plan recommended that one- fifth of the whole force should be coin- posed of the young men under thie age of twenty-one, who alxould under- go twenty-eight days' traiing emeli ycar, one-fifth of Firat Service men te be traied for fourteen days, and the remaining three-fifths, of First, Second and Third Reservists, the First with five days' training, the Second with five days~' training up to thirty years of age, andI then muster antI review only 'with the Third up to forty-five. \"The residue beig Final Reserves, the equivalent of the Prus- sian Lazidsturra, eonsistig of meni over forty-five capable of bearî arms.\" Ini an officiai letter covering report, Lieutenant-Colonel Sinel pointed out that the new plan wol give a large number of men ready: the field, and that the First Serv men wonld be nearly ail uninarri Scale D, a table based upon the P? vîncial census of 1861, showed -t] under twenty years of age there i but thirty-one married men; betw4 twenty and thirty, out of 27,998 mj only 7,022 were married; whilst fr thirty to forty years of age as mna as 13,514 were married, and 284 addition were widowers, out of ol 17,477; those fron forty to forty-1 will be nearly ail married with f. ilies.\" Hc proceeded: \"In consid ing the inatter as a State afair, qu apart froin natural feelings, the 1 of the father of a large family i: mucli moreý serions concern fr every national point than that o: person les encuxnbered; the St mnay provide liberal pensions wvidows and chidren, but they, prived of their natural protector,~ run a sad chance of having to c tend with the pressing needs of too early i years.\" Let ns now consider what we sho, have i Canada, if the principles 1 down by Colonel Sinclair w adopted.

The sanie decision, as to the non- payanent of militiamen, inight be adopted as to other classes, if Parlia- mient thought; well. The obligation of the citizen to do hie share towards defending his country is at least as strong as that to serve on juries or to pay sehool or road tax; and inili- tia duty, when universally enforced, would be cheerfuly performed with- out pay. In Nova Scotia, the yearly training was generaily iooked upon as a kind of pidilie. Each Mýilitary District should be divided into Regimental Districts. A regimental district would coutain as neariy as practicable 1,000 men, ho- tween the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five, qualified to serve in the Second Class or First Service men of the Militia. There would bo a battalion of recruits betweeu seven- teen and twenty-one, and five bat- talions of reservists, each including the men of one class. The lieuten- ant-colonel coinmauding the Fir8t Service Battalion would naturaily be the conimanding officer of the regi- mental district. Each battalion might include sucli number of cach arm of the service, infantry, artil- lery, mouiited infantry, cavalry, army service mnen, grenadiers, mia- chine gun men, etc., as iniglt ho deemed desirable, considering the natural features of the district. In Nova Scotia, for instance, there would not seem to be mucli occasion for any large number of mouinted men, -while in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ai- berta, they would bo proportioualiy numerous. in the cases of cities, the regimentai districts iniglit contain a larger nuinher of meu than that just meutionod.

And now the Canadian newspapera, for the flrst timne lu their hlstory, have at Ottawa a censorship of their own; or rather a censorship that ia applicable to them ail, magazines included.

Newspapermen do not regard it as «a thing of beauty\" or \"a joy for- ever,\" and none ' f them have been knowu to propose a toast to it.

The extension and application of the eensorship ini its present fors in this country lias been gradual. It covers matters both of an Imperîal and national character. The wish of the Imperial authorities lias become tolerably weil known to those at Ot- tawa through the constant inter- change of communications. Because of ouir own military activities due to direct participation in the war, there are many things occurring in the Dominion every day in regard to which it is desirable that little, if any- thing, should be made public, and the Canadian. censorship is reaily a coin- bination of some features of tliat in Britain and of regulations that ex- perience is showing are essential to this country.

Reading the regulations one might be pardoned for the im- mediate conclusion that they prohibit the publication of anything and everything but notable successes for the ailied arins, and that even then care should be taken to omit nain - of places at which the victories we: iwon in order to keep the enemy i profound ignorance of the localitie i Let me anticipate some one who mig] risc at this moment to suggest thi perhaps the encniy knows the nami *of those places, by stating at once thi perhaps he doce not.

The answer lias been given: \"Twelve hundred railway labour~era and froin 1,500 to 2,000 teams of horses were set to work involving the use of a dozen steamers for thec trans- port of materi\u0026ls aud provisionis.\" The problem. boldly faced by the -new general manager was one whicli wcll might daunt tlie most venture- some and daring spirit. Van Horne was Ponstantly in sore vexation. There were moments during the work wlieu even William Van Hlorne's stout heart almost failed him. Discourag- ing reports from surveyors and en- gineers, the discovery of! unexpeeted obstacles, the varied phases of wea- ther, main followiiig raim, and flood following rain, made the task liard beyoud the compreliension of ordin- ary man.

When the war came the army that we sent over to Europe made a great impression. But the reaily astound- ing moment came when the Empire was officially informed that Canada was making more sheils than ail the private plants in Great Britain put together I There wa8 another spasm of surprise when Sir Thomas Shaugli- nessy landed iu England and told the public there that aithougli Can- ada was doing this, she eould easily increase lier sheil output ten-fold, and begged to be allowed a bite of the business to that extent.

The vast upheaval caused among the populations of Eur- ope, and the unsettling conditions to which they have been subjected, will surely cause them to look with long- mng eyes to Canada as a land of hope and fortune. The pick of the young men of Europe have been shaken out of their grooves, and many of them wilI not feel like settling back into those grooves again. They have gone through a splendid physical training. Their campaigning experi- ences will have given them a love for the open. The wanderlust will be uipon them after the flrst joy of their return bas worn off. There will be a huge emigration of those who re- turn to Great Britain after the war. Another consideration that will make for emigration f rom Europe mnay be inentioned. The war is rag- ing in the most densely-populated portions of the continent. For in- stance, Belgium had a population of nearly eight millions packed into a strip of country only a littie more than hall the size of Nova Scotia. A dense population can live on a nar- row strip of ground when it grows there. But once disturbed, it is di- tTlcult to get it back. It will be many years before Belgium is in a condition to support the same num- ber of people as it maintained before the war. It may be added that the Quebee Government is already mak- ing plans for establishing colonies of Belgians i the Province of Quebec. With their methods of intensive farmhxg, they should add a valuable element to the population. Their industry and thrift are well known. What has been said of Belgium will be true of large portions of Eur- ope. And it must be remembered that the proportion of killed in bat- tie to the total population will be very sinail.. Great Britain alone couldl easily spare 1,000,000 cmi- grants from her 50,000,000 popula- tion, With Canada looming brighter thaxi ever on the horizon as a land of h1ope and OPPortunity, and with 4 ada now provided as she is by vast new railway systeins with machinery necessary for settier on a colossal scale, we shaîl dont\u003e witness a vast tide o! immigra from, war-haunted Europe. In cornection with this great o! immigration which will su corne, we should be preparing for a reconstruction of our land tiement policy. There is no d, that we were going wrong in this nection prior to, the war, and i allowing conditions to, grow up * tended to drive bona /ide settlern the land.

The evil in this case was twe-fold. First it resulted in a lot of money being sunk ini non-productive specii- lation. Seeond(ly it kept bon\u003cz fide settiers, the real producers of wealth, off the land. 'When a settier went into thus country to take up land h. found that he could nat get land any- viiere within five miles of a railway station, unleas he flrst paid a stag- gering fine to a real estate speculator for the privilege. That is what it amounted to. Instead, tiierefere, of a thriving little farming community springing up aronnd each station, vith a compact littie village in its rentre and transportation close at hiand, sueli farmers as vent i were .sent off ta the. outside of the. five..mile ring, twhere they were isolated from each other, had no littie village com- xnunity of their own, and were far f rom railway transportation. In other words, farming i the new eountry vas made as dreary and as difficuit as possible. There is no need ta enlarge furtiier upon the evils of the read estate boofm or of otiier aspects ot the speculative fever that vas raging. Everybody nov eau se. plainly enougii what it vas leading ta. The marvel of it iill is this, that the. viole thing has been breught te a stop without a national calamity. And the var bas don. it.

It gradnally oozed away, and wiien tiie van broke ont it found Canada once more eeonioiim- cally sound and in its right mind. If the viiole tiiing hadl been arranged by a special dispensatian of Provi- dence, Canada coùld neot have been more gently iieaded off tram national discredit and disas4ter than she wwi by the. war. Ilere, then, is another of the. gains of the, war for us. W.c have been savedl fromi a ealamnity and a siiaking of public confidence in us that voul have set the country back for adecade. There will benonre- petition of that folly in this genera- tien. The lesson of it onlyv remains. Many people feel a gaod deal of anxi.ty an the subjeet of future sup- plies of capital for the develapnent of our eountry. The general idea is that war will exhauat aIl available sources af capital, and thus le.ave nothing for Canadian needq. Sir George Paisii, the, einient financial expert called in by the. British Gev- ernment at thi. begiuning of the war, stated, at the. conclusion of a year et van, that Great J3nitain «in one year bas merely consumed the. annual in- corne o! ber wealtb. and. througii sav- ings ta be made, vill weathe-r the, comning year at iialf the flrst year's expenituireý-thait is, organized on a nev econom.ical hasis, ah. will spend but iialf her aunual income, and no capital, even a! ter making loans to ber Allies.\" Tiie idea that Great Britain, and consequ.ntly the Britishi Empire, will emerge from the. var fluaucially exhausted, is, tiieref are, prepooterous.

The. sanie experienee ahould be re- peated on a larger scale atter the, present war.

Without ini any way undervaluing the importance of the older type of con- servation wliich urges us to abat. wastefulness in thie use of our na- tural resources this article wi]1 deal chiefly with the more novel phases of conservation work which have been classified above as \"the new conserva- tion.\" There la something so, picturesque about a forest, something so fascin- ating to our romantic instincts, that a certain sentimental interest lias at- tached to statisties regarding the de- forestation of #he couxntry, and as a consequence more serions attention lias been given to this phase of the subject than to equally or perhaps --.greater waste in other directions. The annual national waste causedl by ti imperfection of our treatment of mii eral ores is several times that due i the forest lires and wasteful use ( timber. The greater part of this ii efficiency in treating minerais is dic to failure to make use of what dieu istry lias discovered in the last twent years.

Ail this could econom- icaly be made in Canada if the elec- trie snielting of steel eould bie made a littie more profitable. This industry is flow carried on1 in a large way at Trolhaettan, in Sweden, where the great waterfalls supply cheap elec- trie power right at a good shippîug point. We have îdentically similar conditions in the fjords of the Brî- tish Columbia coast, on the Saguenay, and at many other points. Although there have been some splendid pion- eers iu this work in Canada, such as H1aauel, Stansfeld, aud Evans, there is still rooxu for an army of workers. In the production of zinc the ores are mixed wîth carbon and heated in retorts. The carbon unîtes with the oxygen of the ore, thus settîng free the pure metal. Owing to, the low boiling-point of zinc it vapourizes, and the vapour is condenised in an- other chamber. 'When this smelting is doue with exteriial heat the vapour condenses into a liquid, which le tap- ped off and sold in bars. When elc. trie fuel is eiuployed the zinc usually condenses in the forni of a useless powder. Anyone who eau find an explanation of this phenomenon and a way to avoid it will do mucli to further the establishment of an elc- trie zinc iudustry in Britishi Colum-. bia, where there 18 an abundance of both ore and power.

Ail the opportunities, however, are not concerned with metals, snd the greut lumber industry of Canada af- fords a chance to make use of bark, sawdust, and other by-products.

The impasse stili con- tinues on the western front, but in the east there are indications that the Russians are once more gaining the upper hand, due to the withdrawal of German forces for the operations in Serbia and the levelling up of Rus- sian muntion supplies. The treaci. ery of Bulgaria and the eontinued ini- triguing of King Constantine of Greece were overshadowed for a time in Great Britain by tlie neeessity im- posed upon the Government of taking tlie nation more fully into its con- fidence regarding the eampaign as a whole. Mr. Asquitlis statement in the House cleared the air. Sir Ed- ward Carson's explaxiation, whieh f ol- lowed bis resignation fromn the Cab- inet, eonfirmed the impression regard- ing the practical unanimity of the Cabinet on ail the essential questions relating to the war. 'The resigna. tion of Sir Edward Carson lias not strengtliened bis position as a states- man, aithougli it is generaily coneed- ed that lie acted from the higliest mo- tives. That Sir Edward Carson alone, of ail the Conservative members of the Coalition Government, should consider it necessary to resign is ae- cepted by the man in the street as prima facie evidenee that the Cabinet in the main was justified in the poliey it lias pursued in the Balkans. Those who know Sir Edward Carson were not at ail murrsed that hie found it impossible to remain in the Govern- ment. A mani of uncompromising M8 character, his position bn a Coalition Government that depentls for its eýx- istence upon reasonable compromise was bound, sooner or later, to become irksoine. Temperamentaîiy, Sir Ed- ward Carson makes an excellent lead- er in any position where lie can as- sume autocratic powers. It was his flerce unlcompromising disposition and the exercise of dictatorial Powers as leader tliat gave him sueli a command. ibg position during the Ulster revoit against Home Rule. The political in- stinct of the British nation finds ex- pression in compromise, and to this fact is due the remarkable progress in social reforms wlicl in other coun. tries are attained only by revolutjon- ary metliods. A striking example of the inability of Sir Edward Carson to play the game of polities aceordîig to, British ideas was evideneed, ini 1.900, wlien lie led the Unionist cabal against Mr. Balfour's Irisli policy. SQupported by the lateý Marqi of londonderry and the late Lord Ardi. laun, Sir Edward Carson fiercely at. taeked bis own leaders and seeuredj for tlie time being the defeat of Mr. ]3alfour's policy in Ireland. Sir Jiorace Phxnkett was driven out of Parliament, and Mr. Balfoux9s bro- ther, Mr. Gerald Balfour, lad to withdraw from Ireland, where lie was Chîef Seeretary to the Lord Lienten- ant. as a result of Sir Edward Car- sonls campaign against the poliey of \"Balfourian amelioration\".

To Wîn- ston Churchi the issues are always \"grand issues,\" and lie ever appeals from the parish pump to the bigger newspaper-reading publie outside, whose decisions mould publie opinion and move the legisiative maehinery of the State. 11e is a prophet of far- reaching vision, who approaéhes na-. tional problems with a philosophie mîmd, and who knows that the pros- cnt is but a link bctween the past and the future. Mr. Churehjill labori- ously prepares his speeches, and finds fault with some of his colleagues for not taking the trouble to carefujly prepare their publie utterances. He may be heard ail day long before a .big meeting tramping bis bedroom and emphasizing his main points on the furniture, just as Hlenry Gratts.n sud other great orators of the grand style were wont to do iu days gone by.

         "LUCK PROEM ■P\\ID you ever see it in reaping time? A sea •i-/ of gold it is, with gentle billows telling of sleep and not of storm, which, like regiments afoot, salute the reaper and say, \"All is fulfilled in the light of the sun and the way of the earth; let the sharp knife fall.\" The countless million hL-ads are heavy with fruition, and sun glorifies and breeze cradles them to the hour of harvest. The air— like the tingle of water from a moun- tarn-spring in the throat of the worn wayfarer, bringing a sense of the dust of the world flushed away. Arcady? Look closely. Here and there, like islands in the shining yellow sea, are houses— sometimes in a clump of trees, sometimps only like bare-backed domesticity or naked industry in the workfield. Also rising here and there in the ex-panse, clouds that wind skyward, spreading out in a powdery mist. They look like the rolling",

Soon, when September c ies, all that waving sea will be still. What was gold will still be a rusted gold, but near to the eartli — the stubble of the corn now lying in vast gamers by the railway lines, awaiting trans-port east and west and south and across the seas. Not Arcady this, but a land of industry in the grip of industrialists, whose determination to achieve riches is, in spite of themselves, chastened by the magnitude and orderly prccess of nature's travail which is not pain. Nature hides her in-terna! striving under a smother of white for many months in every year, when what is now gold in the sun will be a soft — sometimes, too, a hard — shining coverlet like impacted wool. Then, instead of the majestic clouds of incense from the thrashers, will rise blue spiral wreaths of smoke from the lonely home. Here the farmer rests till spring, comforting himself in the thought that while he waits, far under the snow the .vheat is slowly expanding; and as in April, the white frost flies out of the soil into the sun, it v ill push upward and outward, green and vigorous, greet-",

Not Arcady; and yet many of the joys of Ar- cady are here— bright, singing birds, wide adven-turous rivers, innumerable streams, the squirrel in the wood and the bracicen, the wildcat stealing through the undergrowth, the lizard glittering by the stone, the fish leaping in the stream, the )laint of the whippoorwill, tlie call of the bluebird, the golden flash of the oriole, the honk of the wild geese overhead, the whirr of the mallard from the sedge. And, more than all, a human voice declaring by its joy in song that not only God looks upon the world and finds it very good.",
         "[IS] CHAPTER I \"PIONEERS, O PIONEERS' IF you had stood on the borders of Askatoon, a prairie town, on the pathway to die Rockies one late August day not many years ago, you would have heard a fresh young human voice singing into the morning, as its possessor looked from a coat she was brushing out over the \"field of the cloih of gold,\" which your eye has already been invited to see. With the gift of singing for joy at all, you should be able to sing joyously at twenty-one. This morning singer was just that age; and if you had looked at the golden car-pet of wheat stretching for scores of miles, before you looked at her, you would have thought her curiously in tone with the scene. She was a symphony in gold— nothing less. Her hair, her cheeks, her eyes, her skin, her laugh, her voice— they were all gold. Everything about her was",
         "[15] VOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK SO demonstratively golden that you might have had a suspicion it was made and not born; as though it was unreal, and the girl herself a proper subject of suspicion. The eyelashes were so long and so black, the eyes were so much like a topaz, and the little glint of gold in a tooth, — the one weak member of an otherwise perfect array — that an air of faint artificiality surrounc'.'d what was in every other way a remarkable effort of nature to give this region, where she was so very busy, a keynote. Poseurs have said that nature is garish or ex-aggerated in this or that; but it is a libel. She is aristocratic to the nth degree, and is never over-done ; she has courage but no ostentation. There was, however, just a slight touch of overemphasis in this singing-girl's presentation — that you were bound to say, if you considered her quite apart from her place in this nature-scheme. She was not wholly aristocratic; she was lacking in that high, social refinement which would have made her gold not so golden, the black eyelashes not so black. Being unaristocratic is not always a matter of birth, though it may be a matter of par-entage. Her parentage was honest and respectable",
         "[16] PIONEERS, O PIONEER! though not exalted. Her father had been an engineer, who had lost his life on a new railway of the West. His widow had received a pension from the company insufficient to main-tain her, und so she kept two boarders, the coat of one of whom her daughter was now brushing as she sr g. The widow herself was the origin of the girl's slight disqualification for being of that higher circle of selection which nature ar-ranges long before society makes its judicial de-cision. The father had been a man of intelli-gence, which his daughter to a real degree inher-ited; but the mother, as kind a soul as ever lived, was a product of southern English rural life— a little sumptuous, but wholesome, and for her daughter's sake at least, keeping herself well anu safely within the moral pale in the midst of marked temptations. She was forty-five, and it says a good deal for her ample but proper graces that at forty-five she had numerous admirers. The girl was English in appearance, with a touch perhaps of Spanish— why, who can say'? Was it because of those Spanish hidalgos wrecked on the Irish coast long since? Her mind and her tongue, however, were Irish like her father's. You would have liked her, — everybody did— [17]",
         "I YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK yet you would have thought that nature had over-done herself for once, she was so pointedly de-signed to express the ancient dame's colour- scheme, even to the delicate auriferous down on her youthful cheek and the purse-proud look of her faintly retrousse nose; though in fact she never had had a p!irse and scarcely needed one. In any case she had an ample pocket in her dress. This fairly full description of her is given not because she is the most important person in tlie story, but because the end of the story would have been entirely different had it not been for her ; and because she herself was one of those who are so much the sport of circumstances or chance that they express the full meaning of the title of this story. As a line beneath the title explains, the tale concerns a matrimonial deserter. Cer-tainly this girl had never deserted matrimony, though she had on more than one occasion avoided it; and there had been men mean and low enough to imagine they might allure her to the conditions of matrimony without its status. As with her mother the advertisement of her appearance was wholly misleading. A man had once said to her that \"she looked too gay to be good,\" but in all essentials she was as good as",
         "[18] PIONEERS, O pioneers' she was gay, and indeed rather better. Her mother had not kept boarders for seven years widiout getting some useful knowledge of the world, or without imparting useful knowledge; and there were men who, having paid their bills on demand, turned from xier wiser if not bet-ter men. Because they had pursued the old but inglorious profession of hunting tame things, Mrs. Tyndall Tynan had exacted compensation in one way or another— by extras, by occasional and deliberate omission of table luxuries, and by making them pay for their own mending, which she herself only did when her boarders behaved diemselves well. She scored in any contest— in spite of her rather small brain, large heart, and ardent appearance. A very clever, shiftless Irish husband had made her develop shrewdness, and she was so busy watching and fending her daugh-ter th'it she did not need to watch and fend her-self to die same extent as she would have done had she been free and childless and thirty. The widow Tynan was practical, and she saw none 0-, those things whicl made her daughter stand for minutes ^.t a time and look into the distance over the prairie towards the sunset light or the grey-blue foothills. She never sang— she had",
         "[19] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK never sung a note in her life; but this girl of hers, with a man's coat in her hand, and eyes on the joyous scene before her, was forever hum-ming or singing. She had even sunf in the church choir till she declined to do so any longer, because strangers stared at her so; which goes to show that she was not so vain as people of her colouring sometimes are. It was just as bad, however, when she sat in the congregation; for then, too, if she sang, people stared at her. So it was that she seldom went to church at all ; but It was not because of this that her ideas of right and wrong were quite individual and not con-ventional, as the tale of the matrimonial deserter will show. This was not church, however, and briskly ap-plying a light whisk-broom to the coat, she sang one of the songs her father taught her when he was in his buoyant or in his sentimental moods, and that was a good portion of the time. It used to perplex her — the thrilling buoyancy and the creepy melancholy which alternately held her father; but as a child she had become so inured to it that she was not surprised at the alternate pensive gaiety and the blazing exhilaration of the particular man whose coat she now dusted",
         "[20] \"I-IONEERS, O PIONEERS\" long after there remained a sf xk of dust upon It. This was the song she sa.:g: \"Whereaway, whereaway goes the lad that once was mine; Hereaway I waited him, hereaway and oft; Hereaway I loved him well, for my heart was soft. \"Hereaway my heart was soft; when he kissed my happy Home I saw upon the earth, heaven stood there in the skies — • 'Whereaway, whereaway goes my lover now!' \" ■mereaway goes my lad-tell me, has he gone aIone.\u003e Never harsh word did I speak, never hurt I gave- Strong he was and beautiful; like a heron he has flown- Hereaway, hereaway will I make my grave. \"When o«ee more the lad I loved hereaway, hereaway. Comes to lay his hand in mine, kiss me on the brow, I W.I1 wbsper down the wind, he will weep to hear me Whereaway, whereaway goes my lover now!\"",
         "[21] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK There was a plaintive quality in the voice of this golden creature in perfect keeping with the music and the words; and though her lips smiled, there was a deep, far-away look in her eyes more in harmony with the craning autumn than with this gorgeous harvest-time. For a moment after she had finished singing she stood unmoving, absorbed by the far horizon ; then suddenly she gave a little shake of the body and said in a brisk, playfully reproving way; \"Kitty Tynan, Kitty Tynan, what a girl you are!\" There was no one near, so far as eye could s-^- , so it was clear the words were addressed to her-self. She was expressing that wonder which so many folk feel at discovering in themselves char-acteristics heretofore imrecognised, or find them-selves doing things out of their natural orbit, as they think. If any one had told Kitty Tynan that she had rare imagination she would have wondered what was meant. If any one had said to her, \"What are you dreaming about, Kitty?\" she would have understood, however, for she had had fits of dreaming ever since she was a child, and these fits had increased .luring the past few",
         "[22] PIONEERS, O PIONEERS' years— since the man came to live with them whose coat she had been brushing. Perhaps this was only imitation, because che man had a habit of standing or sitting still and looking into space for minutes— and on Sundays for hours— at a time; and often she had watched him as he lay on his back in the long grass, head on a hillock, hat down over his eyes, while the smoke from his pipe came curling up from beneath die rim. Also she had seen him more than once sitting with a letter before him and gazing at it for many mmutes together. The curious diing was that it was the same letter on each occasion. It was a closed letter, and it also was unstamp^-d. She knew that, because she had seen it in his desk —the desk once belonging to her father, a slop ing diing widi a green-baize top. Sometimes he kept it locked, but very often he did not; ard more than once, when he had asked her to get him something from the desk, not out of meanness, but chiefly because her moral standard had not a multitude of delicate punctilios, she had lookeo curiously at diis letter. The envelope bore a woman's handwriting, and the name on it was not tfiat of the man who owned the coat— and the letter. The name on the envelope was Shiel",
         "[23] YOU N K V F, R KNOW YOUR I, U C K Crozier, but the name of the man who jwned the coat was J. G. Kcrr\u003e' — James Gathome Kerry, so he said. Kitty Tynan had certainly enough imagina-tion to make her cherish a mystery. She won-dered greatly what it all meant. Never in any-thing else had she been inquisitive or prying where this man was concerned; but she felt that this letter had the heart of a story, and she made up fifty stories which she thought would fit the case of J. G. Kerry, who for over four years had lived in her mother's house. He had become part of her life, perhaps just because he was a man — and what home is a real home without a man? — perhaps because he always had a kind, quief woia for her, and sometimes a word of buoyant cheer-fulness; indeed, he showed in his manner occa-sionally almost a boisterous hilarity. He un-doubtedly was what her mother called \"a queer dick,\" but also \"a pippin with a perfect core,\" which was her way of saying that he was a man to be trusted with herself and with her daugh-ter; who would stand loyally by a friend or a woman. He had stood by them both when Au gustus Burlingame, the lawyer, who had boarded with them when J. G. Kerry first came, coarsely",
         "[24] P 1 O N K E R S , O I O « E E RS ' ' exceeded the bounds of liberal friendliness which marked die household, and by furtive attempts at intimacy began to make life impossible for both mother and daughter. Burlingamc took it into his head, when he received notice that his rooms were needed for another boarder, that J. G. Kerry was the cause of it. Perhaps this was not without reason, since Kerry had seen Kitty Tynan angrily unclasping Burlingame's arm from around her waist, and had used cutting and de- cisive words to the sensualist afterwards. There had taken the place of Augustus Bur-lingamc a land-agent— Jesse Bulrush— who came and went like a catapult, now in domicile for three days together, now rone for three weeks; a volubk, gaseous, humorous fellow, who covered up a well of commercial eva-siveness, honesty and adroitness by a perspiring gaiety natural in its origin and convenient for harmless deceit. He was fifty, and no gallant .save m words; and though a bachelor of so many years' standing it was a long time before he showed a tendency even to blandish a good-look- mg middle-aged nurse named Egan who also lodged with Mrs. Tynan; though even a plain- faced nurse in uniform has an advantage over a",
         "[2S] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK handsome unprofessional woman. Jesse Bul-rush and J. G. Kerry were friends— became such confidential friends indeed to all appearance, though their social origin was evidently so dif-ferent, that Kitty Tynan, when she wished to have a pleasant conversation which gave her a glow for hours after, talked to the fat man of his lean and aristocratic-looking friend. \"Got his head where it ought to be — on his shoulders; and it ain't for playing football with,\" was the frequent remark of Mr. Bulrush con-cerning Mr. Kerry; and this always made Kitty Tynan want to sing, she could not have told why, save that it seemed to her the equivalent of a long history of the man whose past lay in mists that never lifted, and whom even the in-quisitive Burlingame had been unable to probe when he lived in the same house. But then Kitty Tynan was as fond of singing as a canary, and relieved her feelings constantly by this vir-tuous and becoming means, with her good con-tralto voice— a creature of contradictions; for if ever any one should have had a soprano voice it was she. She looked a soprano. What she was thinking of as she sang with Kerry's coat in her hand it would be hard to dis-",

         "I YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK \"Villain!\" he said gaily, for he was in one of his ebullient moods — after a long talk with Jesse Bulrush. \"Hither with my coat; my spot-less coat in a spotted world, — the unbelievable anomaly — 'For the earth of a dusty to-day Is the dust of an earthy to-morrow,' \" When he talked like this she did not under-stand him, but she thought it was clever beyond thinking — a heavenly jumble. \"If it wasn't for me you'd be carted for rubbish,\" she replied joy-ously as she helped him on with his coat, though he had made a motion to take i from her. \"I heard you singing — what was it?\" he asked cheerfully on the surface, though his mind was on weighty things. The song she had sung, floating through the air, had seemed familiar to him, while he had been greatly preoccupied with a big thing — a big business thing, which he had been planning for a long time, with Jesse Bulrush in the background or foreground, as scout or rear-guard or what you will. \" 'Whereaway, whereaway goes the lad that once was mine, Hereaway I waited him, hereaway and oft — ' \" [28]",
         "i ■pi O N K K R S , O P I O N l; £ R s ' she hummed with an exaggerated gaiety in her voice, for the song had made her sad, she knew not why. At the words the flaming exhilaration of his look vanished, his eyes took on a strange poign-ant, distant look. \"That— oh, that!\" he said, and with a little jerk of the head and a clenching of the hand he moved towards the street. \"Your hat!\" she called after him, and ran in-side the house. An instant later she gave it to him. Now his face was clear and his eyes smiled kindly at her. '\"Whereaway, hereaway,' is a wonderful song,\" he said. \"We used to sing it when I was a boy— and after, and after. It's an old song —as old as the hills. Well, thanks— Kitty Ty-nan. What a girl you are, to be so kind to a fel-low like me !\" he added. \"Kitty Tynan, what a girl you are\"— these were the very words she had used about her-self a little while before. The song— why did it make Mr. Kerry go so strange m face all in a moment when he heard it? Kitty watched him striding down the street into the town.",
         "[29] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK Now a voice— a rich, quizzical, kindly voice — called out to her. \"Come, come. Miss Tynan, I want to be helped on with my coat,\" it said. Inside the house a fat, awkward man was struggling, or pretending to struggle, into his coat. \"Roll into It, Mr. Roly-poly,\" she answered cheerily as she entered. \"Of course I'm not the star-boarder— nothing for rue!\" he said in affected irony and protest. \"A little more to starboard and you'll get the coat on,\" she retorted with a glint of her late father's raillery, and she gave the coat a twitch which put it right on the ample shoulders. \"Bully! bully!\" he said; \"I'll give you the tip ic: the Askatoon cup.\" \"I'm a Christian. I hate horse-racers and gamblers,\" she returned mockingly. \"I'll turn Christian— I want to be loved, not hated,\" he chortled in the doorway. \"Roll on, proud porpoise!\" she returned, which shows that her conversation was not quite aristocratic at all times. \"Golly, but she's a gold dollar in a gold bank!\" Jesse Bulrush said as he lurched into the street.

So it was with Shiel Crozier. Does not the rame suggest a man lean and flat, sinewy, angular and isolated like a figure in one of El Greco's pictures in the Prado at Madrid? Does not the name suggest a figure of elongated humanity with a touch of ancient mysticism and yet also of the fantastical humour of Don Quixote? In outward appearance Shiel Crozier, other-wise J. G. Kerry, of Askatoon, was like his name for the greater part of the time. Take him in repose and he looked a lank ascetic who dreamed of a happy laad where flagellation was a joy and",
         "[88] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK pain a panacea. In action, however, as when Kitty Tynan helped him on with his coat, he was a pure improvisation of nature. He had a face with a Cromwellian mole, which broke out in emo-tion like an April day, with eyes changing from a blue-^rey to the deepest ultramarine that ever delighted the soul and made the reputation of an Old Master. Even in die prairie town of Aska- toon, where every man is so busy that he scarcely knows his own children when he meets them, and almost requires an introduction to his wife when the door closes on them at bedtime, people took a second look at him when he passed. Many who came in much direct contact with him, as Augustus Burlingame the lawyer, had done, tried to draw from him all there was to tell about him-self; which is a friendly custom of the far West. The native-born greatly desire to tell about them-selves. They wear their hearts on their sleeves, and are childlike in the frank recitals of all they were and are and hope to be. This covers up also a good deal of business acumen, shrewdness and secretiveness which is not so childlike and bland. In this they are in sharp contrast to those not native-bom. These come from many places on",

Some of them go to the prairie country to forget they ever lived before, and to begin the world again, having been hurt in life undeserv-ingly; some go to bury their mistakes or worse in pioneer work and adventure; some flee from a wrath that would devour them— the law, soci-ety, or a woman. This much must be said at once for Crozier, that he had no crime to hide. It was net be-cause of crime that \"He buckles up his mouth like the bellyband on a bronco,\" as Malachi Deely, the exile from Tralee, said of him; and Deely was a man of \"horse-sense,\" no doubt because he was a horse-doctor— \"a veterenny surgeon,\" as his friends called him when they wished to flatter him. Deely added to t'us chaste remark about the bronco, that \"Same as the bronco, you buckle him tightest when you know the divil is stirring in his underbrush.\" And he added further, \" 'Tis a woman that's put the mumplaster on his tongue, Sibley, and I bet you a hundred it's an-other man's wife.\" Like many a speculator, Malachi Deely would have made no profit out of his bet in the end, for Shiel Crozier had had no trouble with the law",

There was hint of it in his occasional profound abstraction; but more than all else by the fact that here he was, a gentleman, having lived his life for over four years past as a sort of horse- expert, overseer, and stud-manager for Terry Brennan, the absentee millionaire. In the opin-ion of the West, \"big-bugs\" didn't come down to this kind of occupation unless they had been roughly handled b;' j;u\\; or fortune— by the law, society, or a woman. \"Talk? Watch me now— he talks like a tes-timonial in a frame,\" said Malachi Deely on the da^ this tale opens, to John Sibley, the gambling young farmer who, strange to say, did well out of both gambling and farming. \"Words to him are like nuts to a monkey — he's an artist, that man is. Been in the circles where the band plays good and soft, where the music smells — fairly smells like parfumery,\" re-sponded Sibley. \"I'd like to get at the bottom of him. There's a real good story under his as-bestos vest— something that'd make a man call for the oh-be-joyful, same as I do now!\"",
         "[36] CLOSING THE DOORS After they had seen the world through the bot-tom of a tumbler Decly continued the gossip. \"Watch me now — been a friend of dukes in Eng-land and Ireland, that Mr. James Gathome Kerry as any one can see; and there he is now feelin' the hocks of a filly or openin' the jaws of a stud-horse, age hunting! Why, you needn't tell me — I've had my mind made up ever since the day he broke the temper of that Inniskillen chestnut of Mr. Brennan's, and won the gold cup with her afterwards. He just sort of appeared out of the mist of the marnin', tliere being a divil's lot of excursions and conferences and holy gath-erings in Askatoon that time back, ostensible for the business which their names denote, like the Dioceesan Conference and the Pure White Water Society. That was their bluff; but they'd come for one good pure white dioceesan thing before all, and that was to see the dandiest horse-racing which ever infested the West. Come — he come like that !\" — Deely made a motion like the swoop of an aeroplane to earth — \"and here he is buckin' about like a rough-neck same as you and me ; but yet a gent, a swell, a cream della cream, that's turned his back on a lady — a lady not his own wife, that's my belief.\"",
         "[37] YOU NEVER KNO W YOUR LUCK \"You surely have got women on the brain,\" retorted Sibley. \"I ain't ever seen such a man as you.

I'd like to whisper in his ear that he'd better be lookin' sharp for the Mac- mahon Gang, and that if he's a man of peace he'd best take a holiday till after next week, or get smallpox or something.\" The two friends lounged slowly up the street, and presently parted near the door of the bank. As Sibley waited, his attention was drawn to a window on the opposite side of the street at an angle from themselves. The light was such that the room was revealed to its farthest corners, and Sibley noted that three men were evidently care-fully watching the bank, and that one of the men was Studd Bradley, the so-called boss. The",
         "[43] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK Others were local men of some weight and position commercially and financially in the town. Sibley did not give any sign that he noticed the three men, but he watched carefully from under the rim of his hat. His observant imagination, how-ever, read a story of consequeice in the secretive vigilance of the three, who evidently thought that, standing far back in the room, they could not b*\" seen. Pre-ntly the door of the bank opened, and Sibley saw Studd Bradley lean forward eagerly, then draw back and speak hurriedly to his com-panions, using a gesture of satisfaction. \"Something damn funny there!\" Sibley said to himself, and stepped forward to Crozier with a friendly exclamation. Crozier turned rather impatiently, for his face was aflame with some exciting reflection. At this moment his eyes were the deepest blue that could be imagined — an almost impossible colour, like that of the Mediterranean when it reflects the perfect sapphire of the sky. There was some-thing almost wonderful in their expression. A woman once said as she looked at a picture of Herschel, whose eyes had the unworldly gaze of the great dreamer looking beyond this sphere,",
         "[44] '^^PSI NO THE DOORS The stars startled him.\" Such a look was in Croziers eyes now, as though he was seeing the ^nght end of a long road, the desire of his That, indeed, was what he saw. After two years of secret negotiation he had (from acci-dental kno.., kdge got from Jesse Bulrush, his fel- ow-boarder) come to die accomplishment of a big land deal m relation to the route of a new railt way and a town-site, which would mean more to him than any one could know.

He thought that he could get the money at any time, so good was the proposition; and it was best to leave raising the money to the last moment to avoid some one else cutting in and forestalling him. He must first have the stake to be played for before he moved to get the money with which to make the throw. This is not generally thought a good way, but it was his way, and it had yet to be tested. There was no cloud of apprehension, however, in Crozier's eyes as they met those of Sibley. He liked Sibley. At this point it is not necessary to say why. The reason will appear in due time. Sibley's face had always something of that im-mobility and gravity which Crozier's face had part of the time — paler, less intelligent, with dark lines and secret shadows which Crozier's face had not; but still with some of the El Greco characteristics which marked so powerfully that of Shiel Crozier, who passed as J. G. Kerry. \"Ah, Sibley,\" he said, \"glad to see you ! Any-thing I can do for you?\" \"It's the other way if there's any doing at all,\" was the quick response. \"Well, let's walk along together,\" remarked Crozier cheerfully, though a little abstractedly,",
         "[46] CLOSING THE DOORS for he was thinking hard about his great enter-prise. \"We might be seen,\" said Sibley, widi an obvious undermeaning meant to provoke a ques-tion. Crozier caught the undertone of suggestion. \"Being about to burgle the bank, it's well not to be seen together — eh?\" \"No, I'm not in on that business, Mr. Kerry. I'm for breaking banks, not burgling 'em,'- was the grim, merry reply. They laughed, but Crozier knew that the ob-servant gambling farmer was not talking at hap-hazard. They had met on the highway, as it were, many times since Crozier had come to Askatoon, and Crozier knew his man. \"Well, what are we going to do and who will see us if we do it?\" Crozier asked briskly. \"Studd Bradley and his secret-service corps have got their eyes on this street — and on you,\" returned Sibley dryly. Croziefs face sobered from its exhilaration and his eyes became less emotional. \"I don't see them anywhere,\" he answered, but looking no-where. \"They're in Gus Burlingame's office. They",

I've no more idea what it is you're trying to run off with than I know what an ace is going to do when there's a joker in the pack,\" remarked Sibley; \"but I thought I'd tell you that Bradley and his lot are watchin' you gettin' ready to run.\" Then he hastily told what he had seen. Crozier was reassured. It was natural that Bradley \u0026 Co. should take an interest in his move-ments. They would make a pile of money if he pulled off the deal — far more than he would. It wasn't strange that they should watch him going into the bank. They knew he wanted money, and a bank was the place to get it. That was the way he viewed the matter on the instant. He replied to Sibley cheerfully. \"A hundred to one is a lot when you win it,\" he said enigmatically. \"It depends on how much you have on,\" was Sibley's quiet reply — \"a dollar or a thousand dol-lars. If you've got a big thing on, and you've",

It's pretty well guessed what you're going to say and what you know, and you take it from me, the Macmahon mob that's behind Logan '11 have it in for you.

I don't like to see men sneaking about and watch-ing. If they do, you can bet there's something wrong. But the other thing, the Logan Trial business, is a dead certainty.

By following my instincts I've saved myself a whole lot in my time.\" \"Yes, all men that run chances have their su-perstitions, and they're not to be sneered at,\" re-plied Crozier thoughtfully. \"If you see black, don't play white; if you see a chestnut crumpled up, put your money on the bay even when the chestnut is a favourite. Of course you're super-stitious, Sibley. The tan and the green baize are covered with ghosts that want to help you, if you'll let them.\" Sibley's mouth opened in amazement. Crozier was speaking with the look of the man who hypnotizes himself, who \"sees things,\" who dreams as only the gambler and the plunger on the turf do dream, no^ jven excepting the latter- day Irish poets. \"Say, I was right what I said to Deely — I was [50] !l 1 I",
         "ii CLOSING THE DOORI right,\" remarked Sibley almost huskily, for it seemed to him as though he had found a long- lost brother. No man except one who had staked all he had again and again could have looked or spoken like that. Crozier looked at the other thoughtfully for a moment, then he said: \"I don't know what you said to Deely, but I do know that I'm going to the Logan Trial in spite of the Macmahon mob. I don't feel about it as you do. I've got a different feeling, Sibley. I'll play the game out. I shall not hedge. I shall not play for safety. It's everything on the favourite this time.\" \"You'll excuse me, but morphia-sucking Gus Burlingame is for the defence, and he's got his knife into you,\" returned Sibley. \"Not yet.\" Crozier smiled almost sardonic-ally. \"Well, I apologise, but what I've said, Mr. Kerry, is said as man to man. You're ridin' game in a tough place, as any man has to do who starts with only his pants and his head on.

I am not taking it, but I am taking a pledge to return the compliment to you if ever I get the chance.\" \"Well, most men get chances of that kind,\" was the gratified reply of the gamblin.,' farmer, and then Crozier turned quickly and entered the doorway of the British Bank, the rival of that from which he had turned in disappointment a little while before. Left alone in the street, Sibley looked back with the instinct of the hunter. As he expected, he saw a head thrust out from the window where Studd Bradley and his friends had been. There was a hotel opposite the British Bank. He en-tered and waited. Bradley and one of his com-panions presently came in and seated themselves far back in the shadow, where they could watch the doorway of the bank. It was quite a half-hour before Shiel Crozier",
         "[38] CLOSING THE DOORS emerged from the bank. His face was set and pale. For an instant he s'l^^d as though won-dering which way to go, then ..e moved up the street the way he had come. Sibley heard a low, poisonous laugh of tri-umph rankle through the hotel office. He turned round. Bradley, the overfed, overconfident, overestimated financier, laid his hand on the shoulder of his companion as they moved towards the door. \"That's another gate shut,\" he said. \"I guess we can close 'em all with a little care. It's working all right. He's got no chance of rais- mg the cash,\" he added, as the two passed tlie chair where Sibley sat with his hat over his eyes, chewing an unlighted cigar. \"I don't know what it is, but it's dirt— and muck at that,\" John Sibley remarked as he rose from his chair and followed the two into the street. Bradley and his friends were trying steadily to close up the avenues of credit to the man to whom the success of his enterprise meant so much. To crowd him out would mean an extra hundred and fifty thousand dollars for themselves.",
         "[53] CHAPTER III THE LOGAN TRIAL AND WHAT CAME OF IT WHAT the case was in which Shiel Crozier was to give evidence is not important; what came from the giving of his testimony is all that matters; and this story would never have been written if he had not entered the witness- box. A court-room at any time seems a little warmer than any other spot to all except the prisoner; but on a July day it is likely to be a punishment for both innocent and guilty. A man had been killed by one of the group of toughs called locally the Macmahon Gang, and against the charge of murder that of manslaughter had been set up in defence; and manslaughter might mean jail for a year or two or no jail at all. Any evi-dence which justified the charge of murder would mean not jail, but the rope in due course; for [54] '",
         "! THE LOGAN TRIAL this was not Montana or Tdaho where the law's delays outlasted even the memory of the crime committed. The court-room of Askatoon was crowded to suffocation, for the Macmahons were detested, and the murdered man had a good reputation in the district. Besides, a widow and three chil-dren mourned their loss, and the widow was in court. Also Crozier's evidence was expected to be sensational, and to r^rove the swivel on which the fate of the accused man would hang. Among those on the inside it was also known that the clever but dissipated Augustus Burlingame, the counsel for the prisoner, had a grudge against Crozier — ^no one quite knew why except Kitty Tynan and her mother — and that cross-examina-tion would be pressed mercilessly when Crozier entered the witness-box. As Burlingame came into the court-room he said to the Young Doctor, — he was always spoken of as the Young Doctor in Askatoon, though he had been there a good many years and he was no longer as young as he looked — who was also called as a witness, \"We'll know more about Mr. J. G. Kerry when this trial is over than will suit his book.\" It did not occur to Augustus Burlingame that Crozier might",
         "[3S] VOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK find a way of throwing doubt on the fitness of the lawyer to represent innocence or the law, in view of the reason why he had fled the house of the showy but virtuous Mrs. Tynan. Crozier entered the witness-box at a stage when excitement was at fever height; for the Mac- mahon Gang had given evidence which every one believed to be perjured; and the widow of the slain man was weeping bitterly in her seat because of noxious falsehoods sworn against her honest husband. There was certainly something very credible and prepossessing in the apr '.ranee of Crozier. He might be this or that, but ne carried no evil or vice of character in his face. He was in his grave mood this summer afternoon. There he stood with his long face and the very heavy eye-brows, clean-shaven, hard-bitten, as though by wind and weather, composed and forceful, the mole on his chin a kind of challenge to the verti-cal dimple in his cheek, his high forehead more benevolent than intellectual, his brown hair faintly sprinkled with gray and a bit unmanage-able, his fathomless eyes shining. \"No man ought to have such eyes,\" remarked a woman present to the Young Doctor, who ab-",
         "[56] THE LOGAN TRIAL stractedly noddeu assent, for like Malachi Deely and John Sibley, he himself had a theory about Crozier; and he had a fear of what the savage enmity of the morally and physically diseased Burlingame might do. He had made up his mind that so intense a scrupulousness as Crozier had shown since coming to Askatoon had behind ■t not only character, but the rigidity of a set purpose; and that view was supported by the stem economy of Crozier's daily life, broken only by sudden bursts of generosity for those in need. In the box Crozier kept his eye on the crown attorney, who prosecuted, and on the judge. He appeared not to see any one in the court-room, though Kitty Tynan had so placed herself that he must see her if he looked at the audience at all. Kitty thought him magnificent as he told his story with a simply parsimony, but a thrilling choice of words which made every syllable poign-ant with effect. She liked him in his grave mood even better than when he was afflame with an internal fire of his own creation, when he was almost wildly vivid with life. \"He's two men,\" she had often said to herself; and she said it now as she looked at him in the witness-box, measuring out his words and meas-",

Crozier was about to step down when Burlingame rose. \"I wish to ask a few questions,\" he said. Crozier bowed and turned, again grasping the rail of the witness-box with one hand, while with an air of both cogitation and suspense he stroked his chin with the long fingers of the other hand. \"What is your name?\" asked Burlingame in a tone a little louder than he had used hitherto in the trial, indeed even louder than lawyers gen-erally use when they want to bully a witness. In this case it was as though he wished to sum-mon and startle the attention of the court. For a second Crozier's fingers caught his chin almost spasmodically. The real meaning of the",

For a moment his heart seemed to stand still, and he turned slightly pale, but the blue of his eyes took on a new steely look— a look also of striking watchfulness, as of an animal conscious of its danger, yet conscious, too, of its power when at bay. \"What is your name?\" Burlingame asked again in a somewhat louder tone, and turned to look at the jurjs as if bidding them note the hesi-tation of the witness; though, indeed, the wait-ing was so slight that none but a trickster like Burlingame would have taken advantage of it, and only then when there was much behind. For a moment longer Crozier remained silent, getting strength, as it were, and saying to him-self, \"What does he know?\" and then, with a composed look of inquiry at the judge, who ap-peared to take no notice, he said: \"I have al-ready, in evidence, given my name to the court.\" \"Witness, what is your name?\" again almost shouted the lawyer with a note of indignation in his voice, as though here was a dangerous fellow committing a misdemeanour in their very presence.

A look of hatred came into the decadent but able lawyer's face. \"Where do you live when you are at home?\" \"The house of Mrs. Tynan is the only home I have at present.\" He was outwitting the pursuer so far, but it only gained him time, as he knew; and he knew also that no suggestive hint concerning the episode at Mrs. Tynan's, when Burlingame was asked to leave her house, would be of any avail now. \"Where were you bom?\"",

The swish of a skirt seemed ridiculously loud in the hush, and the scratching of the judge's quill pen was noisily irritating. \"My name in Ireland was James Shiel Ga- thome Crozier, commonly called Shiel Crozier,\" came die calm reply from the witness-box. \"James Shiel Gathome Crozier in Ireland, but James Gatfiome Kerry here!\" Burlingame turned",

I have said he had no profession. He lived on his money on his estate.\" The judge waved down the laughter at Burlin- game's expense. \"In official documents what was his descrip-tion?\" snarled Burlingame. \" 'Gentleman' was his designation in official documents.\" \"You, then, were the son of a gentleman?\" There was a hateful suggestion in the tone.",
         "[62] THE LOOAN TRIAL \"I was.\" \"A legitimate son?\" Nothing in Crozier's face showed what he felt, except his eyes, and they had a look in them which might well have made his questioner shrink. He turned calmly to the judge. \"Your honor, does this bear upon the case? Must I answer this legal libertine?\" At the word libertine, the judge, the whole court, and the audience started; but it was pres-ently clear the witness meant that the questioner was abusing his legal privileges, though the peo-ple present interpreted it another way, and quite rightly. The reply of the judge was in favour of the lawyer. \"I do not quite see the full significance of the line of defence, but I think I must allow the ques-tion,\" was the judge's gentle and reluctant reply, for he was greatly impressed by this witness, by his transparent honesty and straightforward-ness. \"Were you a legitimate son of John Gathome Crozier and his wife?\" asked Burlingame. \"Yes, a legitimate son,\" answered Crozier in an even voice.",
         "n YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK \"Is John Gathorne Crozier still living?\" \"I said that gentleman was his designation in official documents. I supposed that would con-vey the fact that he was not living, but I see you do not quickly grasp a point.\" Burlingame was stung by the laughter in the court and ventured a riposte. \"But is once a gentleman always a gentleman an infallible rule?\" \"I sup{X)se not; I did not mean to convey that; but once a rogue always a bad lawyer holds good in every country,\" was Crozier's comment in a low, quiet voice which stirred, startled, and amused the audience again. \"I must ask counsel to put questions which have some relevance even to his own line of de-fence,\" remarked the judge sternly. \"This is not a comer grocery.\" Burlingame bowed. He had had a facer, but he had also shown the witness to have been living under an assumed name. That was a good start. He hoped to add to the discredit. He had ab-solutely no knowledge of Crozier's origin and past; but he was in a position to find it out if Crozier told the truth on oath, and he was sure he would.",

It began with that and ended with nothing.\" \"Then you escaped?\" \"From creditors, lawyers, and other such?

Again there was a struggle on the part of the audience not to laugh outright, and so be driven from the court as had been thi-u- ened. The judge interposed again with the remark, not very severe in tone, that die witness was not m the box to ask questions, but to answer them. At die same time he must remind counsel that the examination must discontinue unless some- thmg more relevant immediately appeared in the evidence. There was silence again for a moment, and even Crozier himself seemed to steel himself for a question he felt was coming. \"Are you married or single?\" asked Burlin-",

She had never allowed her-self to think of that, but even if she had, what difference could it make whether he was married or single, since he was out of her star'? \"Are you not married now?\" \"I do not know.\" \"You mean you do not know if you have been divorced?\" \"No.\" \"You mean your wife is dead?\" \"No.\" \"What do you mean?

He greatly liked the witness. \"Do you deny that you parted from your wife in anger?\" \"When I am asked that question I will try to answer it.

Burlingame asked two questions more. \"Why did you chan\"- your name when you came here?\" \"I wanted l \u003e obliterate myself.\" \"I put it to you, that what you want is to avoid the outraged law \u003c/f yf;.ir own country,\" \"No — I wa.it to avoid the outrageous lawyers of yours.\" Again there was a pause in th* procewlings, and on a protest from the m/wn attorney the judge put an end *o the cross-examination with the solemn reminder to a hushed assembly that a man was being tried for his li^i, and that the present proceedings were a lamentable reflection on the levity of human nature — at least of human na-",

Will he say in what way he incurred the obligation'? Are we to assume that it was through gambling— card-playing, or other games of chance'?\" Through backmg the wrong horse,\" was Crozier's instant reply. \"That phrase is often applied to mining or other unreal flights for fortune,\" said the judge with a dry smile. \"This was a real horse on a real flight to the winning-post,\" added Crozier with a quirk at the comer of his mouth. \"Honest contest with man or horse is no crime, but it is tragedy to stake all on the contest and lose,\" was the judge's grave and pedagogic com-ment. \"We shall now hear from the counsel for defence his reason for conducting his cross-ex-amination on such unusual lines.

Buriingame started hesitatingly, got into his stride, assembled the points of his defence with the skill of which he really was capable, when he was not under the influence of morphia, in which he occasionally indulged as a kind of antidote to less occasional bouts of drink. He made a strong appeal for acquittal, but if not complete acquittal, then manslaughter. He showed that the only real evidence which could convict his man of murder was that of the witness Crozier. If he had been content to discredit evidence of the witness by an adroit but guarded misuse of the facts he had brought out regarding Crozier's past; to emphasize the fact that he was living under an assumed narr.e and that his bona fides was doubt-ful, he might have impressed the jury to some slight degree. He could not, however, control the malice he felt, and he was smarting from Crozier's retorts. He had a vanity easily lacerated, and he was now too savage to abate the ferocity of his forensic attack. He sat down, however, with a sure sense of failure. Every orator knows when he is beating the air, even [73]",

He de-clared that to discredit Crozier's evidence because he chose to use another name than his own, be-cause he was parted from his wife, because he left England practically penniless to earn an honest living — no one had shown it was not — was the last resort of legal desjjeratioo. It was an indefensible thing to endeavour to create prej-udice against a man because of his own evidence given with great frankness. Not one single word of evidence had the defence brought to discredit Crozier, save by Crozier's own word of mouth, and if Crozier had cared to commit perjury the defence could not have proved him guilty of it.

In a long experience he had never seen animus against a witness so recklessly ex-hibited as by counsel in this case. The judge was not quite so severe in his sum-ming up, but he did say of Crozier that his direct replies to Burlingame's questions, intended to prejudice him in the eyes of the community into which he had come a stranger, bore undoubted evidence of truth; for if he had chosen to say what might have saved him from the suspicions, ill or well founded of his present fellow citizens, he might have done so with impunity, save for the reproach of his own conscience. On the whole the judge summed up powerfully against the prisoner Logan, with the result that the jury were not out for more than a half-hour. Their verdict was guilty of murder. In the scene which followed, Crozier dropped his head into his hand and sat immovable and overcome as the judge put on the black cap and delivered sentence. When the prisoner left the dock, and the crowd began to disperse, satisfied that justice had been done— save in that small circle where the Macmahons were supreme— Cro-zier rose with other witnesses to leave.

It was when he was twenty-one and had bee.i sent away to Algiers because he was falling ' l love with a farmer's daughter. As he drove down a lane with his father towards the railway station, those long years ago, he had seen the girl's face looking at him from the window of a labourer's cottage at the crossroads; and its stupified pain and disap-pointment haunted him for many years, even after the girl had married and gone to live in Scotland — that place of torment for an Irish per-son. The look in Kitty Tynan's face reminded him of that farmer's lass in his boyhood's history. He was to blame then — was he to blame now? Certainly not consciously, certainly not by any in-tended word or act. Now he met her eyes and smiled at her, not gaily, not gravely, but with a kind of whimsical helplessness; for she was the first to remind him that he was leaving the cour- room in a different position (if not a different man) from that in which he entered it. He had entered the court-room as James Gathome",

He saw faces turned to him, a few with intense curiosity, fewer still v.ith a little furtiveness, some with amusement, and many with unmistak-able approval; for one thing was clear, if his own evidence was correct: he was the son of a baronet, he was heir-presumptive to a baronetcy, and he had scored off Augustus Burlingame in a way which delighted a naturally humorous peo-ple. He noted, however, that the nod which Studd Bradley, the financier, gave him had in it an enigmatic something which puzzled him. Surely Bradley could not be prejudiced against him because of the evidence he had given. There was nothing criminal in living under an as-sumed name, which, anyhow, was his own name in three-fourths of it, and in the other part was the name of the county where he was bom. \"Divils me own, I told you he was up among the dukes,\" said Malachi Deely to John Sibley as they came out. \"And he's from me own county, and I know the name well enough; an' a damn [77]",

That was when, having diagnosed correctly and operated, a new and un-expected seat of trouble and peril was exposed, and instant action had to be taken. The great man naturally rose to the situation and dealt with it coolly and implacably; but he paid the price afterwards in his sleep when, night after night, he performed the operation over and over again with the same strain on his subconscious self. So it was with Kitty Tynan in her small way. She had insisted on being allowed to help at the operation, and the Young Doctor, who had a",

When the banker had to leave the room at the sight of the carnage, she remained, and she and John Sibley were as cool as the Young Doctor and his fellow- anatomist, till it was all over, and Shicl Crazier was started again on a safe journey back to health. Then a thing, which would hive been amusing if it had not been so deeply human, hap-pened. She and Johr. Sibley went out of the house together into the moonlit night, and the reaction seized them both at the same moment. She gave a gulp and burst into tears, and he, though as tall as Crozier, also broke down, and they sat on the stump of a tree together, her hand in his, and cried like two children. \"Never since I was a little runt— did I— never cried in thirty years— and here I am— leaking like a pail !\" Thus spoke John Sibley in gasps and squeez- mg Kitty's hand all the time unconsciously, but spontaneously, and as part of what he felt.

In truth, he knew only too well. Great surgeons do surgery only and have in-numerable operations to give them skill; but a country physician and surgeon must be a sane be-ing to keep his nerve when called on to use the knife, nnd he must have a more than usual gift for such business. That is what the Young Doc-tor had; but he knew that it was not easy to for-get those scenes in which man carved the body of fellow man, laying bare the very vitals of exist-ence, seeing \"the wheels go round.\" It haunted Kitty Tynan in the nighttime, and perhaps it was that which toned down a little the colour of her face — the kind of difference of colouring there is between natural gold and 14-carat.

Kitty's eyes told their own story, and it made him very uneasy and remorseful. Yet he could not re-member when, even for an instant, he had played with her. She had always seemed part of a sim-ple family life for which he and Jesse Bulrush and her mother and the nurse— Nurse Egan— were responsible. What a blessing Nurse Egan had been ! Otherwise all the nursing would have been performed by Kitty and her mother, .nd it might well have broken them down, for they were well determined to nurse him themselves. When, however, Nurse Egan came back two days after the operation was performed they in-cluded her in the responsibility, as one of the family; and as she had no odier important case on at the time, fortunately she could give Crozier her almost undivided attention. She had been at first disposed to keep Kitty out of the sick- chamber, as no place for a girl, but she soon aban-doned that position, for Kitty was not the girl ever to think of impropriety. Rather primitive [93]",

Her mind was essentially pure, and nothing material in her had been awakened. Her greatest joy was to do the many things for the patient which a nurse must do — prepare his food, give him drink, adjust his pillows, bathe his face and hands, take his temperature; and on his part he tried hard to disguise from her the appre-hension he felt, and to avoid any hint by word or look that he saw anything save the actions of a kind heart. True, her views as to what was proper and what was improper might possibly be on a different plane from his own. For in-stance, he had seen girls of her station in the West kiss young men freely — men whom they never expected to marry and had no thought of marry-ing; and that was not the custom of his own class in his home-country. As he got well slowly, and life opened out be-fore him again, he felt that he had to pursue a new course, and in that course he must take ac-count of Kitty Tynan, though he could not de-cide how.

Crozier gave one of those little jerks of the head characteristic of him and said, \"Why, of course, I knew he would do that after I gave my evidence in the Logan Trial.\" He raised him-self on his elbow. \"I owe you a great deal,\" he added feelingly, \"and I can't repay you in cash or kindness for what you have done; but it is due you to tell you my whole story, and that is what I propose to do now.\"",

It was this kind of feeling which per-vaded that region of sentient being when Shiel Crozier told his story.

I was out against the universe. But it wasn't serious at all— just a boy's mania— till one day my father met me in London when I came down from Oxford, and took me to Brooks's Club in S\".

Kitty Tynan's eyes were fixed on him as though hypnotised, and the Young Doctor was scarcely less interested; while the widow of the departed .ngineer knitted harder and faster than she had ever done, and she could knit very fast indeed. \"It was the betting-book of Brooks's, and it dated back almost to the time of the conquest of Quebec.

I oughtn't to have married.\" His voice had changed in tone, his look become r^ n grave, there was something very like a look of awe in his face, of deprecating submission in his eyes. His fingers fussed with the rug that covered his knees. \"God help the man that's afraid of his own wife I\" remarked the Young Doctor to himself, not erroneously reading the expression of Cro- zier-s face and the tone of his voice. \"There's nothing so unnerving.\" \"No, I oughtn't to have done it,\" Crozier went on. \"But I will say again it wasn't a sordid marriage, though she had expectations, great ex-pectations—but not immediate; and she was a girl of great character.

She had pictured to herself a gossamer kind of woman, delicate, and in contour like one of the fashion- plate figures she saw in the picture-papers. She had imagined her with a wide, drooping hat, with a soft, clinging gown, and a bodice like a great white handkerchief crossed on her breast, holding a basket of flowers, while a King Charles spaniel gambolled at her feet. This was what she had imagined with a kind of awe; but the few words Crozier had said of her gave the impression of a Juno commanding and exacting, bullying, sailing on with this man of men in her wake, who was afraid of ste[)ping on her train. Why shouldn't she think that? She was only a simple prairie girl who drew her own comparisons according to her kind and from what she knew of life. So she imagined Crozier's wife to have been a sort of person like Zenobia Queen of Palmyra, who swept up the dust of the universe with her skirts, and gave no chance at all to the children of nature called Kitty, who wore skirts scarcely lower than their ankles. She al-most sniiled, and she became angry, too, that a man like Crozier, who had faced the offensive",

It was enough to make a cat laugh — or a woman cry with rage. \"Able and brilliant and splendid and far-seeing and radiantly handsome!\" There the picture was of a high, haughty, and overbearing woman, in velvet, or brocade, or pojilin— \u003exs, something stifl and overbearing like grey poplin. Kitty looked at herself suddenly in the mirror— the half-length mirror on the opjjosite wall— and she felt her hands clench and her bosom beat hard under her pretty and inexpensive calico frock— a thing for Chloe, not for Juno. She was very angry with Crozier, for it was absurd, that look of deprecating homage, that re-cumbent respect in his face, that \"Hush— she— is —coming\" in his eyes.

What sort of a woman was she anyhow, who could let him go away as he had done and live apart from her all these years, while he \"slogged away\" — that was the Western phrase which came to her mind — to pull himself level with things again? Her feet shuffled unevenly on the floor, and it would have been a joy to shake the invalid there with the rapt look on his face. Unable to bear the situation without some demonstration, she got to her feet and caught up the glass of brandy and milk with a little ex-clamation. \"Here,\" she said, holding the glass to his lips; \"here, keep up your strength, soldier. You don't need to be afraid at a five-thousand-mile range.\" The Young Doctor started, for she had said what was in his own mind, hut what he would not have said for a thousand dollars.

I'd have saved what was left of a fortune, and I'd have had a home of my own.\" \"Is he earning her living too?\" asked Kitty softly, and Crozier did not notice the irony under the question. \"She has a home of her own,\" answered Cro-zier almost sharply, certainly with a little nerv-ousness. \"Just before the worst came to the worst she inherited her fortune— plenty of it, as I got near the end of mine.

They both knew that here was the real tragedy of Crozier's life. If he had had less reverence for his wife, less of that ob-vious prostration of soul, he probably would never have come to Askatoon or would have left Ireland. \"I broke my promise,\" he murmured. \"It was a horse — well, never mind. I was as sure of Flamingo as that the sun would rise by day and set by night. It was a certainty; and it was a certainty. The horse could win, it would win — I had it from a sure source. My judgment was right, too. I bet heavily on Flamingo, intending it for my last fling, and to save what I had left, to get back what I had lost. I could get big odds on him. It was good enough. From what I knew it was like picking up a gold-mine. And I was right — right as could be. There was no chance about it. It was being out where the rain fell to get wet.

They began to see light where their man was con-cerned. After a moment of struggle to control himself, Crozier proceeded. \"It didn't seem like betting. Besides, I had planned it, that when I showed her what I had won, she would shut her eyes to the broken promise, and I'd make another and keep it ever after. I put on all the cash there was to put on— all I could raise on what I had left of my property.\" He paused as though to get strength to go on. Then a look of intense excitement suddenly pos-sessed him, and there passed over him a wave of feeling which transformed him.

He said he had never seen her so an-gry, and he gave me a letter from her. On her return to town she had been obliged to go away at once to see her sister taken suddenly ill.

In a moment Kitty was beside him with the letter. He took it, turned it over, examined it carefully as though seeing it for the fir=t time, and laid it on his kne^;. \"I have never opened it,\" he said. \"There it is, just as it was handed to me.\" \"You don't know what is in it?\" asked Kitty in a shocked voice. \"Why, it may be tliat— \" \"Oh, yes, I know what is in it I\" he replied. \"Her brother's confidences were enough.

Somehow she seemed to herself twenty years older than this man with the heart of a boy, who was afraid of his own wife. \"It's time for jour beef-tea, and when you've had it you must get your sleep,\" she said with a hovering solicitude in her voice. \"I'd like to give him a thrashing first, if you don't mind,\" said the Young Doctor to her. \"Please let a little good advice satisfy you,\" Crozier remarked ruefully. \"It will seem like old times,\" he added rather bitterly. \"You are too young to have had 'old times,' \" said Kitty with gentle scorn. \"I'll like you bet-ter when you are older,\" she added. \"Naughty jade,\" exclaimed the Young Doc-tor, \"you ought to be more respectful to those older than yourself.\" \"Oh, grandpapa!\" she retorted mockingly.",

The grain was cut, the prairie no longer waved like a golden sea, but the smoke of the incense of sacrifice still rose in innumerable spirals in the circle of the eye. The ground appeared bare and ill-treated, like a sheep first shorn; but yet nothing could take away from it the look of plenty, even as the fai sides of the shorn sheep invite the satisfied eye of the expert. The land now, all stubble, still looked good for anything. If bare, it did not seem starved. It was naked and unshaven; it was stripped like a boxer for the rubbing down after the fight. Not so refined and suggestive and luxurious as when it was clodied with the coat of ripe corn in the ear, it still showed the muscle and fibre of its being to no disadvantage. [125]",

September saw the vast prairie spaces around Askatoon shorn and shrivelled of its glory of rip-ened grain, but with a new lift come into the air — sweet, stinging, vibrant life, which had the suggestion of nature recreating her vitality, in-flaming itself with Edenic strength, a battery charging itself, to charge the world in turn with its force and energy. Morning gave pure ela-tion, as though all created being must strive ; noon was the pulse of existence at the top of its activ-ity; evening was glamorous; and all the lower sky was spread with those colours which Titian stole from the joyous horizon that filled his eyes. There was in that evening light somehow just a touch of pensiveness — the triste delicacy of helio-trope, harbinger of the Indian si -^mer soon to come, when the air would make all sensitive souls turn to the past and forget that to-morrow was all in all.

These heeded it little, even though a good number of them came from the damp is-lands lying between the north Atlantic and die German Ocean. From Erin and England and die land \u0026 cakes they came, had a few days of star-ing bright-eyed happy incredulity as to the per-manency of such conditions, and then setded down to take it as it was— endless days of sun-shine and stirring vivacious air— as diough they had always known it and had it. There were exceptions, and these had joy in what diey saw and felt according to the measure of dieir temperament.

Before Crozier came she had enjoyed existence as existence, wondering often why it was she wanted to spring up from the ground with the idea that she could fly, if she chose to try. Once when she was quite a little girl she had said to her mother, \"I'm going to ile away,\" and her mother, puzzled, asked her what she meant. Her reply was, \"It is in the hymn.\" Her mother persisted in asking what hymn ; and was told with something like scorn that it was the hymn she herself had taught her only child — \"I'll away, I'll away to the Promised Land.\" She had thought that \"I'll away\" meant that there was some delicious motion which was to ile, and she had visions of something between floating and flying as being that blessed means of transportation. As the yeare grew, she still wanted to \"ile away\" whenever the spirit of elation came upon her, and it had increased greatly since Shiel Cro-zier came.

As long ago as she could recall she had, in a crude, untutored way, been fond of the things that nature made beautiful; but now she seemed to see them in a new light; but not because any one had deliberately taught her. Indeed, it bored her almost to hear books read as Jesse Bul-rush and Nurse Egan and the Young Doctor, and even her mother, read them to Crozier after his operation, to help him pass away the time. The only time she ever cared to listen— at school, though quick and clever, she had never cared for the printed page— was when, by chance, poetry or verses were read or recited, Then she would listen eagerly, not attracted by the words, but by the music of the lines, by the rhyme and rhythm, by the underlying feeling; and she got something",

By accident, however, his business made it necessary for him to be much in Askatoon at the moment, and it was a propitious time for the growth of the finer feelings. It had given Jesse Bulrush real satisfaction that Kitty Tynan listened to his reading of poetry — Longfellow, Byron, Tennyson, VVhyte Mel-ville, and Adam Lindsay Gordon chiefly — with such absorbed interest. His content was the greater because his lovely nurse — he did think she was lovely, as Rubens thought his painted ladies beautiful, though their cordial, ample, os-tentatious proportions are not what Raphael re-garded as the lines of the divine human figure — because his lovely nurse listened to his fat, happy voice rising and falling, swelling and re- [181]",

He found her in her usual place, with a look al-most pensive on her face.

Read them to her as you read them to me, and she'll only hear your voice, and she'll think them clever and you a wonderful man, even if you are fifty and weigh five hundred pounds.

For a long time she sat brooding, forgetful of the present and of the little comedy of elderly lovers going on inside the house. She was think-ing of the way conventions hold and bind us ; of the lack of freedom in the lives of all, unless they live in wild places beyond the social pale. Within the past few weeks she had had visions of such a world beyond this active and ordered civilisation, where the will and the conscience of a man or woman was the only law. She was not lawless in mind or spirit. She was only rebell-ing against a situation in which she was bound hand and foot, and could not follow her honest and exclusive desire, if she wished to do so. Here was a man who was married, yet in a real sense he had no wife. Suppose that man cared for her, what a tragedy it would be for them to be kept apart! This man did not love her; and so there was no tragedy for both; yet all was not over yet — yes, all was \"over and over and over,\" she said to herself as she sprang to her feet with a sharp exclamation of disgust — with herself.",

His wife and the past had been shadowy in a. way, had been as part of a life lived out, which would return in some distant day, but was not vital to the present. Much as he had loved his wife, the violent wrench away from her had seemed almost as complete as death itself; but the resumption of his own name and the telling of his story had produced a complete psychological change in him mentally and bodily. The impersonal feeling which had marked his re-lations with the two women of this household, and with all women, was suddenly gone. He longed for the arms of a woman round his neck — it was five years since any woman's arms had been there, since he had kissed any woman's lips. Now in the hour when his fortunes were again in the fatal balance, when he would be started again for a fair race with the wife from whom he had been so long parted, another face came between. All at once the question Burlingame ?sked him as to whether his wife was living came to him. He had never for an instant thought of her as dead, but now a sharp and terrifying anxiety came to him.

Once he got up in the dark and drank great draughts of water; once again as he thought of Mona, his wife, as she was in the first days of their married life, a sudden impulse seized him. He sprang from his bed, lit a can-dle, went to the desk where his unopened letter lay, and took it out. With the feeling that he must destroy this record, this unread but, as he knew, ugly record of their differences, and so clear her memory of any cruelty, of any act of anger, he was about to hold it tc the flame of the candle when he thought he heard a sound be-hind him as of the door of his room gently clos-ing. Laying the letter down, he went to the door and opened it. There was no one stirring. Yet he had a feeling as though some one was there in the darkness. His lips framed the words, \"Who is it?

But as he closed the door softly the words of the song that Kitty Tynan had sung to him the day when he found her brushing his coat came to him and flooded his brain. The last two verses of the song kept drowning his sense of the actual, and he was swayed by the superstition of bygone ancestors: \"\\1 hereaway goes my lad — tell me, has he gone alone?

She did not even wait to show it to the Young Doctor; but he had a subtle instinct as to why she did not; and he was rather more puzzled than usual at what was pass-ing before his eyes.

Admiring Crozier as he did, he also had underneath all his knowledge of life a wholesome fear — or an un-reasonable apprehension of man's weakness where a woman was concerned. The man who would face a cannon's mouth would falter before the face of a woman whom he could crumple with one hand. The wife arrived before Crozier returned, and he and Kitty met the train. The local telegraph-ist had not divulged to any one the contents of the telegram to Kitty, and there were no staring spectators on the platform.

Now she leaned forwu.d with heart beatmg fast, but with smiling face and with eyes so bright that she deceived the Young Doc-tor. There was no sign of inward emotion, of h . den troubles, as she leaned forward to see the great lady step from the train— great in every sense was this lady in her mind; imposing in stat-ure, a Juno, a tragedy queen, a Zenobia, a daugh-ter of the gods who would not stoop to conquer. She looked in vain, however, for the Mrs. Cro- zier she had imagined made no appearance from the train. She hastened down the platform still with keen eyes scanning the passengers who were mostly alighting to stretch their legs and get a breath of air. \"She's not here,\" she said at last darkly to the Young Doctor who had followed her.

Now, with her alert, rather assertive blue eyes she saw Kitty, and came forward. \"Miss Tynan?\" she asked with a smile and an encom-passing look. Now Kitty was idiomatic in her speech at times, and she occasionally used slang of the best brand, but she avoided those colloqu.alisms which were merely part of the vocabulary of the un-educated. Indeed, she had had no inclination to use them, for her father had set her a good example, and she liked to hear good English spoken. That was why Crozier's talk had been like music to her; and she had been keen to dis-tinguish between the studied rhetorical method of Augustus Burlingame, who modelled himself on the orators Ci\" all the continents, and was what might be called a S}Tithetic elocutionist.

Kitty did not notice that, but the Young Doctor took it in with his embracing glance as the wife encompassed Kitty with her inward com-ment, which was — \"So this is the chit who wrote to me like a mother!\" But Mona Crozier did not underestimate Kitty for all that, and she wondered why it was that Kitty had written as she did. One thing was quite clear: Kitty had had good intentions, else why have written at all?

He had a romantic medieval view, which translated weakness and beauty into a miracle, and what psychologists call \"an inspired control.\" \"She's no bigger than— than a wasp,\" said Kitty to herself, after the Young Doctor had as-sured Mrs. Crozier that her husband was almost well again; that he had recovered more quickly than was expected, and had gained strength won-derfully after the crisis was passed. \"An elephant can crush you, but a wasp can sting you,\" was Kitty's further inward comment, and that's why he was always nervous when he spoKc of her.\" Then, as the Young Doctor had already done, she noticed the tiny lines about the [187]",

The Young Doctor attributed these lines mostly to anxiety and inward suffering, but Kitty set them down as the outward signs of an inward fretfulness and quarrelsomeness, which was rendered all the more offensive in her eyes by the fact that Mona Crozier was the most spot-less thing she had ever seen, at the end of a jour-ney — and this, a joumey across a continent. Orderliness and prim exactness, taste and fas-tidiousness, tireless tidiness were seen in every turn, in every fold of her dress, in the wa) every-thing she wore had been put on, in the decision of every step and gesture. Kitty noticed all this, and she said to herself, \"Wound up like a watch, cut like a cameo,\" and she instinctively felt the little dainty cameo brooch at her own throat, the only jewelry she ever wore, or had ever worn. \"Sensible of her not to bring a maid,\" com-mented the Young Doctor inwardly. \"That would have thrown Kitty into a fit.

The girl had meant well by her husband in sending for his wife — that was certain; and she did not look bad. She was too neat, too sedately and reservedly dressed, in spite of her auriferous face and head and her burnished tone, to be bad: too fearless in eye, too concentrated to be the rover in fields where she had no tenure or right. She turned and looked Kitty squareV in the eyes, and a new, softer look came into her own, subduing what to Kitty was the challenging alert-ness and selfish inquisitiveness and superficiality. \"You have been very good to Shiel — you two kind people,\" she said, and there came a sudden faint mist to her eyes. That was her lucky moment, and she spoke as she did just in time, for Kitty was beginning to resent her deeply; to dislike her far more than was reasonable and certainly without any jus-tice. Kitty spoke up quickly. \"Well, you see, he was always kind and good to other people, and that was why — \" [192]",

Was it hurt pride or dis- . appointed love which spoke in her face, in her words'? After all, it was bad enough that her private life and affairs should be dragged out in a court of law; that these two kind strangers whom she had never seen till a few minutes ago, should be in the inner circle of knowledge of the life of her husband and herself, without her self-esteem being hurt like this. She was very woman, and the look of the thing was not nice to her eyes, while it must belittle her in theirs. Had this girl done it on purpose? Yet why should she — she who had so appealed to her to come to him, have sought to humiliate her? Kitty was not quite sure what she ought to say. \"You see, we expected him back before this. He is very exact — \" \"Very exact?\" asked Mrs. Crozier in astonish-ment. This was a new phase of Shiel Crozier's character. He must, indeed, have changed since he had caused her so much anxiety in days gone by. \"Usen't he to be so?\" asked Kitty a little viciously. \"He is so very exact now,\" she added. [194] ii I!!",

Business — business? \"He doesn't talk himself, of course; that wouldn't be like him\"— Kitty had joy in giving this Wife the character of her husband— \"but they say that if he succeeds in what he's trying to do now he will make a great deal of money.\" \"Then he has not made it yet?\" asked Mrs. Crozier. \"He has always been able to pay his board regularly, with enough left for a pew in church,\" answered Kitty with dry malice; for she mistook the light in the other's eyes, and thought it was avarice; and the love of money had no place in Kitty's make-up.

Quick with love for her mother as she always was, Kitty caught the other's trembling hand. \"You've always had too much to do, mother — alwuys been slaving for others. You've never had time to think whether you're happy or not, or whether you've got a problem — that's what people call things, when they've got so much time on their hands that they make a play of their inside feelings and work it up till it sets them crazy.\" Mrs. Tynan's mouth tightened and her brow clouded. \"I've had my problems too, but I al-ways made quick work of them.

You've had no correspondence for five years— isn't that so?\" \"Did he tell you that?\" the regal little lady asked composedly, but with an underglow of anger in her eyes. \"He told the court that at the Logan Trial,\" was the reply. \"At the murder trial— he told that?\" Mrs. Crozier asked almost mechanically, her face gone pale and a little haggard. \"He was obliged to answer when that wolf Gus Burlingame was after him,\" interposed Kitty with kindness in her tone, for, suddenly, she saw through the outer walls of the little wife's being into the inner courts.

The first glance his wife gave encompassed the walls, the fible, the bureau, and the desk which contained her own unopened letter. She was looking for a photo-graph of herself. There was none in the room, and a parched and arid look came into her face. The glance and its sequel did not escape Kitty's notice. She knew well— as who would not— what Mona Crozier was hoping to see, and she was human enough to feel a kind of satisfaction in the wife's evident chagrin and disappointment; for the un-opened letter in the baize-covered desk which she had read was sufficient warrant for a punish-ment and penalty due the little lady, and not",
         "[211] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK , ; I .1 I i\"^ J- i the less because it was so long delayed. Had not Shiel Crozier had his bitter herbs to drink over the past five years! Moreover Kitty was sure beyond any doubt at all that Shi?! Crozier's wife, when she wrote the letter, did not love her husband, or at least did not love him in the right or true way. She loved him only so far as her then selfish nature permitted her to do; only in so far as the pride of money which she had, and her husband had not, allowed her to do; only in so far as the na-ture of a tyrant could love (though the tyranny was pink and white and sweetly perfumed and had the lure of youth). In her primitive way Kitty had intuitively apprehended the main truth, and that was sufficient to justify her in contributing to Mona Crozier's punishment. Kitty's perceptions were true. At the start Mona was in nature proportionate to her size; and when she married she had not loved Crozier as he had loved her. Maybe that was why — though he may not have admitted it to him-self — he could not bear to be beholden to her when his ruin came. Love makes all things pos-sible, and there is no humiliation in taking from one who loves and is loved — that uncapitalised",

Perhaps that was why, though Shiel loved her, he had had a bitterness which galled his soul, why he had a determination to wm sufficient wealth to make himself independ-ent of her. Down at the bottom of his chival-rous Irish heart he had learned the truth, that to be dependent on her would beget in her contempt for him, and he would be only her paid paramour and not her husband in the true sense. Quixotic he had been, but under his quixotism there was at least the shadow of a great tragical fact, and it had made him a matrimonial deserter. Whether tragedy or comedy would emerge was all on the knees of the gods. \"It's a nice room, isn't it?\" asked Kitty when there had passed from Mona Crozier's eyes the glaze or mist— not of tears, but stupefaction— which had followed her inspection of the walls, the bureau, the table, and the desk. \"Most comfortable, and so very clean— quite spotless,\" the wife answered admiringly, and yet a little drearily. It made her feel humiliated that her man could live this narrow life of one room without despair, with sufficient resistance to the lure of her hundred and fifty thousand [213] (",
         "1^ '!i; i ' I i ill U ; i:lf : ii 1 ■ 'r' '! 1 you NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK pounds and her own delicate and charming per-son. Here, it would seem, he was content. One easy chair made out of a barrel, a couch, a bed —a very narrow bed, like a soldier's, a bed for himself alone— a small table, a shelf on the wall with a dozen books, a little table, a bureau, and an old-fashioned, sloping-topped, shallow desk covered with green baize, on high legs, so that he could stand as he wrote (Crozier had made that high stand for the desk himself) like a sol-dier, too. That was what the room conveyed to her— the spirit of the soldier, bare, rlean, strong, sparse, a workshop and a chamber of sleep in one, like the tent of an officer on the march. After th J feeling had come to her, to heighten the sensation, she espied a little card hung under the small mirror on the wall. There was writing on it, and going nearer she saw in red pencil the words, \"Courage, soldier!\" These were the words which Kitty was so fond of using, ai.d Kitty had a thrill of triumph now as she saw the woman whom Crozier had fled from looking at the card. She herself had come and looked at it many times since Crozier went away, for he had only put it there just before he left on this last expedition to Aspcii Vale to carry",

It had made her feel that she had some share in his life; that, in a way, she had helped him on the march, the vivandiere who earned the water-bag which would give him drink when parched, battle-worn, or wounded. Mona Crozier turned away from the card, sadly reflecting that nothing in the room recalled herself; that she was not here in the very core of his life in even the smallest way. Yet this girl, this sunny creature with the call of youth and passion in her eyes, this Ruth of the wheat- fields, came and went from this room as though she was a part of it. She did this and that for him, and no doubt was on such terms of intimacy with him that they were part of each other's life in a scheme of domesticity which was unlike any boarding-house scheme or organisation she had ever known. Here in everything there was the air and the decorum and the unartificial comfort of home. Visions of apartments and lodgings and boarding-houses in the old land rose up be-fore her, and the contrast was immeasurable. This was why he could live without his wedded wife and her gold and her brocade, and the silk and the Persian rugs, and the grand piano and [215]",

Her husband had had the luxuries of wealth, and here he was living like a Spartan on his hill — and alone; though ht had a wife whom men had besieged both before and after marriage. A feeling of impotent indignation and anger suddenly took possession of her. Here he was with two women, unattached, — one interest-ing and good and agreeable and good looking, and the other almost a beauty — who were part of the whole rustic scheme in which he lived. They made him cwr.fortable, they did the hun-dred things that a valet or a fond wife would do; they no doubt hung on every word he ut-tered — and he could bn interesting beyond most men. She had realised terribly how interesting he was after he had fled; when men came about her and talked to her in many ways, with many variations, but always with the one tune behind all they said; always making for the one goal, no matter the point from which they started or how circuitous their route.

Five years-and not a word from him. Five years and not a letter from him! Her eyes involuntarily fell on the high desk with the green baize top. Of all the letters he had writ-ten at that desk not one had been addressed to her. Slowly, and with an unintentional solem-nity, she went up to it and laid a hand upon it Her chin only cleared the edge of it— he was a tall man, her husband. \"This is the place of secrets, I suppose,\" she said with a bright smile and at attempt at gaiety to Kitty, who had watched her with burning eyes; for she had felt the thrill of the moment. She was as sensitive to atmosphere of diis sad play of life as nearly and as vitally as the de-serted wife. \"I shouldn't think it a place of secrets,\" Kitty answered after a moment. \"He oeldom locks it, and when he does I knov/ where the key is.\" \"Indeed?\" Mona Crozier stiffened. A look of [217]",

It was as though she was looking down from a great height upon a poor creature who did not know the first rudiments of personal honour, the fine elemental customs of life. Kitty saw and understood, but she did not hasten to reply, or to set things right. She met the lofty look imflinchingly, and she had pride and some little malice too — it would do Mrs. Cro- zier good, she thought — in saying, as she looked down on the humming-bird trying to be an eagle : \"I've had to get things for him — ^papers and so on, and send them on when he was away, and even when he was at home I've had to act for him; and so even when it was locked I had to know where the key was. He asked me to help him that way.\" Mona noted the stress laid upon the word \"home,\" and for the first time she had a suspicion that this girl knew more than even the Logan Trial had disclosed, and that she was being sa-tirical and suggestive. \"Oh, of course,\" she returned cheerfully in re-sponse to Kitty — \"you acted as a kind of clerk for him!\" There was a note in her voice which she might",

If she but knew it, she needed this girl's friendship very badly; and she might have remembered that she would not have been here in her husband's room had it not been for the letter Kitty had written-a letter which had made her heart beat so hard when she re-ceived It, that she had sunk helpless to the floor on one of those soft rugs, representing the soft comfort which money can bring. The reply was like a slap in the face. \"I acted for him in any way at all that he wished me to,\" Kitty answered with quiet bold-ness and shining face. Mona's hand fell away from the green baize desk, and her eyes again lost their fight for a mo-ment. Kitty was not savage by nature. She had been goaded as much by the thought of the letter Crozier's wife had written to him in the hour of his ruin as by the presence of the woman in this house, where things would never be as they had been before. She had struck hard, and now she was immediately sorry for it: for this woman was here in response to her own appeal; and, after all, she might well be jealous of the fact that Crozier had had close to him for so long and m such conditions a girl like herself, younger [219] :",

Suddenly she came nearer and touched Kitty's arm. \"And thank you for saying so,\" she added. \"He and I have been so long parted, and you have seen so much more of him than I have of late years! You know him better — as he is. If I said something sharp just now, please forgive me. I am — indeed, I am grateful to you and your mother.\" She paused. It was hard for her to say what she felt she must say, for she did not know how her husband would receive her — he had done without her for so long; and she might need this girl and her mother sorely. The girl was a friend in the best sense, or she would not have sent for her. She must remind herself of this continually lest she should take wrong views.

The islands where she was born were in themselves so miniature that the minds of their people, however small, were not made to feel insignificant. But her mind, which was, after all, vastly larger in proportion than the body enshrin-ing it, felt suddenly that both were lost in a uni-verse. Her impulse was to let go and sink into the helplessness of tears, to be overwhelmed by an unconquerable loneliness; but the Celtic cour-age m her, added to that ancient native pride which prevents one woman from giving way be-fore another woman towards whom she bears jeal- [ 289",

Her fortune had driven him forth when her beauty and her love ought to have kept him close to her, no matter what fate brought to their door, or what his misfortune or the catastrophe falling on him. It was all deeply humiliating, and th- inward de-jection made her now feel that her body was the last effort of a failing creative power.

He told me so just now before he saw her.\" \"Then it's ora pro rcbis — it's pray for us hard,\" rejoined Kitty sorrowfully. \"Poor man from County Kerry!\" At that moment Mrs. Tynan came from the house, her face flushed, her manner slightly agi-tated. \"John Sibley is here, Kitty — with two saddle-horses. He says you promised to ride with him to-day.\" \"I probably did,\" responded Kitty calmly. \"It's a good day for riding, too. But John will have to wait. Please tell him to come back at six o'clock. There'll be plenty of time for an hour's ride before sundown.\" \"Are you lame, dear child?\" asked her mother ironically. \"Because if you're not, perhaps you'll be your own messenger. It's no way to treat a friend — or whatever you like to call him.\" Kitty smiled tenderly at her mother. \"Then would you mind telling him to come here, mother darling? I'm giving this doctor-man a prescrip-tion. Ah, please do what I ask you, mother!",
         "lllll AWAITING THE VERDICT It is true about the prescription. It's not for himself; it's for the foreign people quarantined inside.\" She nodded towards the room where Shiel Crozier and his wife were shaping their fate. As her mother disappeared with a gesture of impatience and the remark that she washed her hands of the whole Sibley business, the Young Doctor said to Kitty: \"What is your prescrip-tion, Mademoiselle Sapphira? Suppose they come out of quarantine with a clean bill of health?\" \"If they do that you needn't make up the pre-scription. But if Aspen Vale hasn't given him what he wanted, then Mr. Shiel Crozier will still be an exile from home and the angel in the house.\" \"What is the prescription? Out with your Sibylline leaves I\" \"It's in that unopened letter. When the let-ter is opened you'll see it effervesce like a seidlitz powder.\" \"But suppose I am not here when the letter is opened?\" he questioned. \"You must be here — you must.

You are incorrigible. I believe you'd have your joke on your death-bed.\" \"I should if you were there. I should die laughing,\" Kitty retorted. \"There will be no death-bed for you, miss. You'll be translated — no, that's not right: no one could translate you.\" \"God might — or a man I loved well enough not to marry him!\" There was a rote of emotion in her laugh as she uttered the words.

Suddenly, with a gesture of confidence and al-most of affection, she laid a hand on the Young Doctor's breast. \"I've left the trail, doctor-man. I'm cutting across the prairie.

Once when she had visited the Coast the Gov-ernor had talked to her with great gusto and friendliness; and she had even gone so far as to touch his arm while, chuckling at her whimsical-ity, he listened to a story she told him of life at the rail-head. And the Governor had patted her fingers in quite a fatherly way— or not, as the mind of the observer saw it; while subsequently his secretary had written verses to her. \"So you've been gambling again — you've broken your promise to me,\" she said reprovingly to Sibley, but with that wonderful, wistful laughter in her eyes. Sibley looked at her in astonishment. \"Who told you*?\" he asked. It had only happened the",

But that he did not count an asset, because he had not himself taken account of this new capital. He had never been a vain or an introspective man in the philosophic sense, and he never had thought that he was of much account. He had lived long on his luck, and nothing had come of it — \"nothing at all, at all,\" as he said to himself when he stepped inside the room where, unknown to him, his wife awaited",

There was a strange timiditj-, and a fear not so strange, in Mona's eyes as she saw her husband enter with that quick step which she had so long-ingly remembered after he had fled from her; but of which she had taken less account when he was with her at Lammis long ago— when Crozier of Lammis was with her long ago. How tall and shapely he was! How large he loomed with the light behind him ! How shadowed his face and how distant the look in his eves ! Somehow the room seemed too small for him, and yet he had lived in this very house for four years and more, he had slept in the next room all that time, had eaten at this table and sat in this very chair— Mrs. Tynan had told her that —for this long time, like the master of a house-hold. With that far-away, brooding look in his face, he seemed in one sense as distant from her",

She had not turned elsewhere, diough there had been temptation enough to do so. Crozier advanced to the centre of the room, even to the table laid for dinner, before he was conscious of some one in the room, of a figure by the chair. For a moment he stood still, startled as if he had seen a vision, and his sight became blurred. When it cleared, Mona was a step nearer to him, and then he saw her clearly. He caught his breath as though life had burst upon him with some staggering revelation. If she had been a woman of genius, as in her way Kitty Tynan was, she would have spoken before he had a chance to do so. Instead, she wished to see how he would greet her, to hear what he would say. She was afraid of him now. It was not her gift to do the right thing by perfect in-stinct; she had to think things out; and so she did now. But it has to be said for her that she also had a strange, deep sense of apprehension and anxiety in the presence of the man whose arms had held her fast, and then let her go for so [258]",

This was a turn of affaire for which he had made no calculation. There had ever been the question of his retum to her but never of her coming to him. Yet here she was debonnaire and fresh and perfectly appointed —and ah, so terribly neat and spectacularly fi-nessed!

He was not tailor-made, and she had ever been so exact that it was as though she had been crystallised, clothes and all— a perfect crystal, yet a crystal. It was this very perfec-tion, so charming to see, but in a sense so in-human, which had ever dismayed him. \"What should I be doing in the home of an angel !\" he had exclaimed to himself in the old home at Lam- mis. Truth is, he ought never to have had such a feeling, and he would not have had it, if she had diffused the radiance of love, which would have made her outer perfectness mere slovenliuess be-side her inner charm and magnetism. Very lit-tle of all this passed through Crozier's mind, as with confused vision he looked at her. He had borne the ordeal of the witness-box in the Logan Trial widi superb coolness; he had been in physi-cal danger ovtr and over again, and had kept his head; he had never been faced by a human being who embarrassed him — except his own wife. \"There is no fear like that of one's own wife\" was the saying of an ancient philosopher, and Crozier had proved it true; not because of errors committed, but because he was as sensitive as a girl of sensibility; because he felt that his",

I've been out of it for five years, and well out of it. What do I care for the world!\" She drew herself up in a spirit of defence. \"It isn't what you care for the world, but I had to live in it — alone, and because I was alone, I was sneered at. It has been easy enough for you — you were where no one knew you. You had your freedom\" — she advanced to the table and, as though unconsciously, he did the same, and they gazed at each other over the white linen and its furnishings — \"and no one was saying that your wife had left you for this or that, because of her bad conduct or of yours.

The pent-up-flood of remorse and resentment and pride and love — the love that tore itself in pieces because it had not the pride and self-respect which independ-ence as to money gives — broke forth in him, fresh as he was from a brutal interview with the financial clique whom he had given the chance to make much money, and who were now, for a few thousand dollars, trying to cudgel him out of his one opportunity to regain a lost place in his lost world. \"I live — I live like this,\" he continued, with a gesture that embraced the room where they were, \"and I have one room to myself where I have lived over four years\" — he pointed to it. \"Do you think I would choose this and all it means— ts poverty and its crudeness, its distance from al.

He saw that a little strand of her beautiful dark hair had broken away from Its ordered place and hung prettily against the rosy, fevered skin of her cheek just beside her ear. He saw that there were no rings on her fingers save one, and that was her wedding-ring — and she had always been fond of wearing rings. He noted involuntarily that in her agitation the white tulle at her bosom had been distu-bed into pretty disarray, and that there was neither brooch nor necklace at her breast or throat. \"If you stay, I am going to stay, too,\" she de-clared in an even yet almost passionate voice, and she spoke with deliberation and a look which left no way open to doubt. She was now a valiant little figure making a fight for happiness.",

Memory of other days was admonishing him. \"What is the good of one loving when the other doesn't? And, anyhow, I made up my mind five years ago that I would not live on my wife. I haven't done so, and I don't mean to do so. I don't mean to take a penny of your money. I should curse it to damnation if I was living on it. I'm not, and I don't mean to do so.\" \"Then I'll stay here and work, too, without it,\" she urged, with a light in her eyes which they had never known.

His lips tightened, his face hardened. \"I will see you in a moment — wait outside, please,\" he added, as Burlingame made as though to step in-side. \"Wait at the gate,\" he added quietly, but with undisguised antipathy. The moment of moments for Mona and him-self had passed. All the bitterness of defeat was on him again. All the humiliation of undeserved failure to accanplish what had been the dear de-sire of five years bore down his spirit now.

Now, however, she was in a position where she must either tell him that Kitty had opened that still sealed letter from herself to him which he had carried all these years; or else tell him an untruth. She had no right to tell him what Kitty h.'.d told her. There was no other way save to lie. \"How should I know?

He turned to the front doorway with a savage gesture. The mutilated dignity of his manhood, the broken pride of a lifetime, the bit-terness in his heart need not be held in check in dealing with the man who waited to give him a last thrust of enmity.

No doubt this grimness of Crozier was due to domestic trouble and not wholly to his own presence. Still, he felt softly for Hie tiny pistol he always carried in his big waistcoat-pocket, and it com-forted him. Beyond the corner of the house Crozier paused and took a key from his pocket. It opened a side-door to his own room, seldom used, since it was always so pleasant in this happy home to go through the main living-room, which every one liked so much that, though it was not the dining- room, it was constantly used as such, and though is was not the parlour, it was its constant sub-stitute. Opening the door Crozier stepped aside to let Burlingame pass. It was over two years since Burlingame had been in this room, and then it had been without invitation. His in- quisitiveness had led him to enter it in the old days when he lived in the house— before he was ejected from it. Entering now, he gave it quick scrutiny.

There was, how-ever, no sign at all of a woman's presence, though there were signs of a woman's care and attention in a number of little things— homelike, solici-tous, perhaps affectionate care and attention. Certamly the spotless pillows, the pretty curtains, the pincushion, and charmingly valanced bed and shelves, cheap though the material was, showed a woman's very friendly care. When he lived in that house there were no such little attentions paid to him! It was his experience that where •such attentions went other things accompanied them. A sensualist himself, it was not conceiv-able to him that men and women could be under the same roof without \"passages of sympathetic friendship and tokens of affinity\"— that was a phrase which he had often used when pursuing his own sort of happiness. His swift scrutiny of the room showed that Crozier's wife had no habitation here, and that gave him his cue for what the French call \"the reconstruction of the crime.\" It certainly was clear that, as he had suggested at the Logan Trial, there was serious trouble in the Crozier",

As Burlingame sat down he noticed on the table a crumpled handkerchief. It had lettering in the comer. He spread it out slightly with his fingers, as though abstractedly thinking of what he was about to say. The initial in the corner was K. Kitty had left it on the tabl . while she was talking to Mrs. Crozier a half-hour before. No matter what Burlingame actually thought or believed, he could not now resist pick-ing up the handkerchief and looking at it with a mocking smile. It was too good a chance to miss.

He had his Crazier now between the upper and the nether mill-stones, and he meant to grind him to the flour of utter abasement. It was clear that the arrival of Mrs. Crozier had brought him no relief, for Crozier's face was not that of a man who had found and opened a casket of good fortune. \"Rather dangerous that, in the bedroom of a family man!\" he said, picking up the handker-chief and looking suggestively from the letter-ing in thr-. corner to Crozier. He laid it down again, smiling detestably. Crozier calmly picked up the handkerchief, saw the lettering, then went quietly to the door of the room and called Mrs. Tynan's name once o. twice. Presently she appeared. Crozier beck-oned her into the room. When she entered he closed the door behind her. \"Mrs. Tynan,\" he said, \"this fellow found your daughter's handkerchief on my table, and he has said regarding it, 'Rather dangerous that, in the bedroom of a family man.' What would you like me to do with him?\" Mrs. Tynan walked up to Burlingame with the look of a woman of the Commune and said: \"If",

When it is over, then he shall go, and we will fumigate the place. Re-garding the tar-and-feathers, you might leave that to me. I think I can arrange it.\" \"I'll turn the hose on him as he goes out, if you don't mind,\" the irate mother exclaimed as she left the room. Crozier nodded. \"Well, that would be ap-propriate, Mrs. Tynan, but it wouldn't cleanse him. He is the original leopard whose spots are there forever.\" By this time Burlingame was on his feet, and a look of craft and fear and ugly meaning was in his face. Morally he was a coward, physically [272] »!i",
         "i '\"TV s roR YOUR pleasure\" he was a coward, but ':- had in his pocket a weapon which gave him a feeling of superiority in the situation ; and after a night of extreme self- indulgence he was in a state of irritation of the nerves which gave him what the searchers after excuses for ungovemed instincts and acts call \"brain-storms.\" He had always had sense enough to know that his amorous escapades would get him into trouble one day, and he had always carried the little piaol which was now so convenient to his hand. It gave him a fic-titious courage which he would not have had un-armed against almost any man— or ■ man— in Askatoon. \"You get a woman to do your fighting for you, he said hatefully. \"You have to drag her in. It was you I meant to challenge, not the poor girl young enough to be your daughter \" His hand went to his waistcoat pocket. Crozier saw and understood. Suddenly Crozier-s eyes blazed. The abnor-mal in him— the Celtic strain always at variance with the normal, an al nost ultra-natural attend-ant of it— awoke like a storm in the tropics His ^ace became transformed, alive with a passion uncanny in its recklessness and purpose. It was",
         "[973] YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK : ii m Hi a brain-storm indeed, but it had behind it a nor-mal power, a moral force which was not to be re-sisted. \"None of your sickly melodrama here.

The habit of thinking you would shoot somebody someiime — somebody you had in-jured — might become too much for you to-day, and then I should have to kill you, and for your wiie's sake I don't want to do that.

Then I should end you, and there'd be another trial; but the lawyer who defended me would not have to cross- examine any witness about your character. It is too well known, Burlingame. Out with it— the pistol !\" he added, standing menacingly over the cowardly lawyer. In a kind of stupor under the storm that was breaking above him Burlingame slowly drew out of a capacious waistcoat-pocket his tiny but pow-erful pistol of the most modern make. \"Put it in my hand,\" insisted Crozier, his eyes on the other's.

Crozier's eyes half closed in an access of stub-bornness and hatred. \"You are not to assume anything whatever,\" h\" declared. \"You are to accommodate yourself to actual facts. The time is not up. It is not up till midnight, and any action taken to-day on any other assumption will give grounds for damages.\" Crozier spoke without passion and with a cold-blooded insistence not lost on Burlingame. Tak-ing down a calendar from the wall, he laid it be-side the paper on the table before the too eager lawyer. \"Examine the dates,\" he said. \"At twelve o'clock to-night Messrs.

He remembered how Gamett had given him the better pony of the two, so that the younger brother, who would be more heavily pun-ished if they were locked out, should have the better chance. And Gamett, if odd in manner and character, had always been a true sportsman though not a lover of sport. If — if — why had he never thought of Gamett? Gamett could help him and he would do so. He would let Gamett stand in with him — take one- third of his profits from the syndicate. Yes, he must ask Garnett to see him through. Then it was that he lifted his head from his hands, and his mind awakened out of a dream as real as though he had actually been asleep. Garnett — alas I Gamett was thousands of miles away, and he had not heard from him for five years. Still, he knew the master of Castlegarry was alive, for he had seen him mentioned in a chance number of 'The Morning Fast lately come .0 his hands. What avail! Gamett was at Castlegarry, and at midnight his chance of fortune and a new life [280]",

There was an alternative he would not attempt to face unti after midnight, when this crisis in his life would be over. Beyond midnight was a dark-ness which he would not now try to pierce. As his eyes again became accommodated to his sur-roundings a look of determination, the determina-tion of the true fatalist, the true gambler, came into his face. The real gambler never gives in till all IS gone; neve: ^ives up till after the last throw of the last penny of cash or credit; for he has seen such innumerable times the thing come right and good fortune extend a friendly hand with the last throw of all. Suddenly he remembered-saw-a scene in the ganibling rooms at Monte Carlo on the only visit he had ever paid to the place. He had played constantly, and had won each day more or less. 1 hen his fortune turned and he lost and lost each day. At last, one evening, he walked up to a table and said to the croupier, \"When was zero up last?\" The croupier answered, \"Not for an hour.\" Forthwith he began to put money on zero and on nothing else. For two hours he",

Increasing his stake, which had begun at five francs and had risen at length to five louis, he still coaxed the unre-sponsive zero. Finally midnight came, and he was the only person playing at the table. All others had gone or had ceased to play. These stayed to watch the \"mad Inglesi,\" as a foreigner called him, knocking his head against the foot-stool of an unresponsive god of chance. The croupiers watched also with somewhat disdainful, somewhat pitying interest, this last representative of a class who have an insane notion that the law of chances is in their favour if they can stick it out long enough. And how often had they seen the stubborn challenger of a black demon, w' '■\u003e would not appear according to the law of chances, leave the table ruined forever. Smiling, Crozier had played on till he had but thirty louis left. Counting them over with a cheerful exactness, he rose up, lit a cigarette, placed the thirty louis on zero with a cynical precision, and with a gay smile kissed his hand to the refractory Nothing and said, \"You've got it all Zero — good-night!

At length he reached out^and touched the writing with a caressing \"Kitty— Kitty, how great you are!\" he said. 1 hen as he turned to the outer door a softness came mto his face, stole up into his brilliant eyes and dimmed them with a tear. \"What a hand to hold in the dark-the dark of life!\" he said aloud. \"Courage, soldier,\" he added as he",

From the dining-room Kitty had watched him go. \"Courage, soldier!\" she whispered after him, and she laughed; but almost immediately she threw her head up with a gasping sigh, and when it was lowered again two tears were steal-ing down her cheeks. With an eflfort she conquered herself, wiped away the tears, and said aloud with a whimsical but none the less pitiful self-reproach, \"Kitty — Kitty Tynan, what a fool you are!\" Entering the room Crozier had left, she went to the desk with the green-baize top, opened it, and took out the fateful letter which Mona Cro-zier had written to her husband five years ago. Putting it into her pocket she returned to the dining-room. She stood there for a moment with her chin in her hands and deep reflection in her eyes, and then, going to the door of her mother's sitting-room, she opened it and beckoned.

Surely this girl was more than reckless in her talk. Kitty was not to be put down. \"If you don't mind plain speaking, he was always with you, but you weren't always with him in those days.

Now, as she looked out of the door, far over the prairie to a tiny group of pine-trees in the vanishing distance, lines she once read floated through her mind: \"A*ay and beyond the point of pines, In a pleasant land where the glad grapei be. Purple and pendant on verdant vines, I know that my fate is awaiting me.\" What fate was to be hers? There was no joy in her eyes as she gazed. Mrs. Crozier was be-side the table again before she roused herself from her trance. \"I've got it — just two sheets, two solitary sheets,\" said Mona in triumph. \"Hotv long they have been in my case I don't know.

We must get the letter back in his desk as soon as possible.\" As Mona wrote Kitty sat with the envelope in her hand, altemately looking at it and into the distance beyond the point of pines. She was certain that she had found the solution of the troubles of Shiel and Mona Crozier, for Crozier would now have his fortune, and the return to his wife was a matter of course. Was she alto-gether sure? But yes, she was altogether sure. She remembered, with a sudden, swift plunge of blood in her veins, that early dawn when she bent over him as he lay beneath the tree, and as she kissed him in his sleep he had murmured, \"My darling!\" That had not been for her, though it had been her kiss which had stirred his dreaming soul to say the words.

There was no more shrewishness left in the lit-tle woman to meet this chastisement. The forces against her were too many. Loneliness and the long struggle to face the world without her man; the determination of this masterful young woman who had been so long a part of her husband's life; and, more than all, a new feeling al-together — love, and the dependence a woman feels, the longing to find rest in strong arms, which comes with the first revelation of love, had conquered what Kitty had called her \"bossiness.\" She was now tremulous before the crisis which she must presently face.

Suddenly she had a revelation of how little she had known of what he was, or what any man was or could be, or of those springs of nature lying far below the outer lives which move in orbits of sheltering convention. It is because some men and women are so sheltered from the storms of life by wealth and comfort that these piercing agonies which strike down to the uttermost depths so seldom reach them. Shiel half turned away, not sullen, not morose, but with a strange apathy settled on him. He had once heard a man say, \"I feel as though I wanted to crawl into a hole and die.\"' That was the way he felt now, for to be beaten in the game which you have played like a man yourself and have been fouled into an unchallenged defeat, without the voice of the umpire, is a fate which has smotlAered the soul of better men than Cro- zier. Mona's voice stopped him. \"Do not go, Shiel,\" she urged gently. \"No, you must not go. I want justice from you, if nothing else. You must play the game with me. I want justice.

She shook her head and made a swift little ch.ldl.ke gesture towards him. \"We are sure of to-day; we are not sure of to-morrow. One or the other of us might not be here to-morrow, i^et us do to-day the thing that belongs to to- That note struck home, for indeed the black sp.nt which whispers to men in their most despa.nng hours to end it all had whispered to him. \"Let us do to-day the thing that belongs to to-day,\" she had just said, and, strange to say there shot into his mind words that belonged to the days when he went to church at Castlegarry and thought of , thousand things other than prayer or praise, but yet heard with the acute ears of the young, and remembered with the [809]",

Courage came to her. \"Let us talk in your room,\" she added, and going ove she opened the door of it and walked in. The ma-tured modesty of a lost five years was not about her now. She was a woman fighting for her hap-piness, and she had been so beaten by the rods of scorn, so smothered by the dust of humiliation, that she had now the courage of those who can bear no more and would rather die fighting than in the lethargy of despair. It was like her old self to take the initiative, but she did it now in so different a way — without masterfulness or assumption.

But here — here is more news. Guess what — it's for you. I've just come from the post-office, and they said there was an English letter for you, so I brought it.\" He handed it over. She laid it in her lap and waited as though for him to go. \"Can't I hear how he is? He's the best man that ever crossed my path,\" he said. \"It happens to be in his wife's, not his, hand-writing — did ever such a scrap of a woman write [S23",
         "] i' YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK SO sprawling a hand!\" she replied, holding the letter up. \"But she'll let us know in the letter how he is, won't she?\" Kitty had now recovered herself, and slowly she opened the envelope and took out die letter. As she did so something fluttered to the ground. Jesse Bulrush picked it up. \"That looks nice,\" he said, and he whistled in surprise. \"It's a money-draft On a bank.\" Kitty, whose eyes were fixed on die big, u.i- portant handwriting, answered calmly and with-out apparently looking, as she took the paper from his hand: \"Yes, it's a wedding present— five hundred dollars— to buy what I like best for my home.

         "[326] E P I L O O U B Good-bye, Mr. Roly-poly.\" she responded, laughing. \"You always could think of things for other people to do; and have never done any-thing yourself until now. Good-bye, fatherl\" When he was gone and out of sight her \"face changed. With sudden anger she crushed and crumpled up the draft for five hundred in her hand. \" -A token of affection from both' !

He does— he does remember.\" She drew herself up with an effort, and, as it were, shook herself free from the memories which dimmed her eyes. Not far away a man was riding toward the clump of trees where she was. She saw, and hastened to her horse. \"If I told John all I feel he'd understand. I believe he always has understood,\" she added with a far-off look. The draft was still crushed in her hand when she mounted the beloved horse, whose name now was Shiel.",
