Collect grass-hoppers from fields and pastures and kili in a cyanide bottie or in a chloroform jar. First notice that the grass-hopper is symmetrical about, its long axis, i. e. the right and left sides of the body are alike. Are the dorsal and ventral sides alîke? As shown in Fig. 1 the body is divisible into three parts; head, thorax or chest, and abdomen. Find these parts in your-specimen, and noté further that- the abdomen is made up of a àumber of rings or segments, called somites. ?Maty forms.in the branch or phylum of animais to whichl the grass-hopper belongs, the jointed- legged animais, have a pair of appendages forevery somite; the grass-hopperand other insects, however, are 2the exception, as their 'abdominal somites 'are free 'from appendages. While a somite may or may not have a pair'of appendages, every pair of appendages represents a somite. Thus the thorax âhows three pairs of legs, so we conclude' that it is made 'up of..three somites. These are shown separated' from one another in- Fig. 1. Note the 'Use of thèise legs, which are especially fitted for hopping? How many pairs of wings has the grass-hopper? Towhich part, and to what particular segments are they attached? Note that the two pairs differ somewhat in tex-' ture. How do they differ in use? When not flying the hind wings are folded up like a fan.

In the mornine,_ we letý our shadows point the way that we shall take, if we have no definite .bbject to iead us in another direction; in the evening we leave the shadows behind. Per- haps there is a natural instinct bidding us follow the course of the sun. We are ail sun worshippers by nature. So, after our greetings to the king of the day, we wil turn our backs to bis brightness and look to the westward, where each drop of dew reflects bis glories in miniature so as to bring them with-- in the range of our -weak visi*on. Low YiU* fields, ail their feathery grasses grey with beads. of moisture, are irridescent in the morning ight. As the sun rises higher, the greys and1 purple disappear, and vegetation is seen in its true coloûrs. The greens and browns are richer now than a t mid-day, for the lurking shadows'bring thein, out More clearly; and the air itself bas a colour whUc belongsonly to the morning hours. We are out - gain in search of ferns; and when' the grasses along the, roadside are dry it is dmti to takre to the fields.. Leaving the dusty road where it crosses the brook, we go up the meadows, of course; for there is another instinct which leads us up stream rather than down.

XXI V.-Tke Baille of Bladensburg and Capture of Washington -The Capture of A lexandria -The Last'Engagement on the Great Lakes - The PJ.attsburg Exped ilion. August 24.-The 'British military operations along the shpres of Chesapeake Bay in the summer of 1814 came flot without warning. After the burning of St. David's, in July of that year, the commander' of the fleet, Admirai Cochrane, formally notified the United States Government that he had been called upon by the Governor-General of Canada to retaliate, against the inhabitants of the United States for the wanton destruction committed by tbeir army in Upper Canada; and that it was bis duty to issue to, the naval forces 'under his command an order to destroy and lay waste such towns'and districts upon the coast as inight be found assailable. To assist in these measures, and for a more definite purpose, transport ships brçught 'from Bermuda. an army of four thousand five hundred mnen comiuanded by Genéral' Ross, an officer who had served with distinction 'under Moore and Wellington in the Peninsular War. Landing on theé twentieth of August on the bank of the Patuxent, at a place called Benedict, about fifty miles south-east. of Washington, Ross led his army across the intervening country to Bladensburg. Blanensburg is situated on the Potomac, a few miles above the capital. The army which met him there was larger than bis own; but it was chiefly composed of raw militia, and was easily put to flight. The battle of Bladensburg took place on the twenty-fourth of August. About eight o'clock ini the levéning . of the same day, the British occupied the city of Washington without furtber r' higndranoe. President Madison and the members of bis cabinethad fled when ihey found that the battle was going against them. No private ' property was- destroyed by the British soldiers in Washington, excepting twc f-houses -front which shots were fired; but thiey burned. nearly ail the public buildings, including 51 the Capitol, thie President's bouse, and the builifini which contained the war office and the ~~; treasury. The navy yard and two shipslying near it bad been ahandoned anid set- on fire, ] destroying a large quantity of ammunition and stores of every description. Next day the British took possession of the navy yard, and complete(l the work of burning the stores and, arsenals. On the evening of the twenty-fifth, having accomplished bis mission, General Ross evacuated .Washington andl began his retreat to Benedi'ct; wbere lie ernbarked bis forces on the. thirtieth, ten day-s after their landing. In tbe British Parliament, as well as else- wbere, there m-ere many to censure the govern- ment for this remorseless deed of vengeance. The ministry, however, fully accepted the responsibility, and justified the work of destruc- tion as an act of reprisai for the burning of the government buildings at York. Lucas, the hâ.i toiian, devotes several pages to a discussion of this question; which he ends by saying tb*at York, though a small town, was the capital éf' a British colony, and the wrongs of the colonkeq should be requited upon the wrongdoers, flot less, but, more than if they had been Inflic\"~d upon the mother land bei-self. General Ross did not live to hear the Britiu Government blamed for the work of his punitory expedition; for to receive the pi-aise that wus due him for his scrupulous respect for private property. To record his name and fame, a monument was erected in St. Paul's Cathedmal,' London, by unanimous vote of Parliament.ý Let tbe inscription tell the rest of the story: \"Erected at the public, expense to the memnory of Major-General Robert Ross; who,- havtifg' undertaken and executed an enterprise against the city of Washington, Capital of the United States of' America, which was crowned with complete success, was killed shortly afterwards kwhile directing -a- successful attack upon ý ' rsuperior force, near the city of Baltimnore,oôn sthe l2th day of September, 1814.\" His grave in Halifax, Nova Scotia, is'marked by a e stone with a lengthy inscription; *hÎch' tells us that there is a more elaborate monumen~t-,à to his memory at his home in Ireland. i August 29.-While General, Ross's arjny wa8 .J retiring f rom Washington by way of the Patuxentý eanother expedition was ascending the Potomac~ Bto take the town of Alexandria and hold it téë ransom.

The facts of his life will be foiind in whatever edition of the poeit is used, but they should be enlivened from the teacher's fulier knowledge. Lockhart's \"Life,\" one of the greatest biographies in the language, is to be had in Everyman's Library, and should* be thoroughly known. The attention of the student should be drawn to such points as these Scott's childish love of stories, out of door life, gamies, aûid fighting; his wonderful memory, bis industry, bis ambitions; bis love of bis own country and district, and familiarity witb its histôry and legends; his friendships; love for herses an~d dogs and, of field sports; bis untiring kindness, courtesy and generosity; bis story-writing, -first i poetry,, then in prose; -the interest in and mystery about the Waverley Novrels; the high honour, courage and considera- \u003e don for others with which lie met bis troubles and the disappointment of ail his bopes.

Do net confie yourself to one way of approacb, but try te fnd- those that lead to individual ,'tereuý, Remember that your aim i. to belp your pupité to read with understanding and witli pleaur, and that most of tliem need a good deal, of help at first. Consuit the notes on\"A You Like It\" in the REviEW for September, I 1912, for a general plan. The \"Introduction\" is a charming setting or framework for the story. (Cf. the setting of, the \" Canterbury Tales\"; Longfellow's \"Tales of a Wayside Inn\" and other tales), It should be thoroughly studied. Points to be grasped, are:- the time; the place; the figure of the old harpeâ, (find William Pitt's comment on this in Scott!s - \"Life\"); the character of the Duchess; the succession of pictures. The lines at, the end of each canto should be studied in the samne way, as you corne to them. DuIl children, unused to reading, need to be guarded from confusing 'the setting with the story itself. THE SToRY.-Note the description of the conditions at Branksome Hall and how they. prepare us for a story of strife. Tell the pupils ~ that the opening of a story usualiy gives us tbë time, place, mont important characters, and'ioieý idea of what kind of story it i. to be. If it W - a story of difficulties or struggles of any sort, then we generaliy find out from the begimiing what those struggles are to be about. Your- class may be able to illustrate this from 900*u story they have read. This 'story begins with the death of Lord. Walter, and this is an histri cal fact and took place -in 1562. That fixes the date. The complications of the -story am indicated in the lines, \"And if 1 live to be a mani My father's death revenged shall be.\" \"her mother dread, Before Lord Cranstoun she uhould wed, 'Would see her on her dy ing bed.\" and in the account of the magical powers possessed by the Ladye. A further'complicatio comes in later, in the episode of the GoblinjPage but this is.not well worked out, aàd is rather confusing. Mr. Hutton says, \" venture to say that no reader of the poem ever has distinctIlr understood what the goblin page- did or did not do, what it was that was \" lost \" througliout the@ poem, and \" found \" at its conclusion,. what was his object in personating the young hefr, anid whether \"or flot that1 object. was auswered.'

A story for reproduction, with crude illustrations, will hold their attention, or perhaps a short story placed' on the board with blanksý to be filled in-the completed story to be copied on their siates - will give the teach- er sMST idea of their progress.

AN EXPLANATION Last November we printed in the REvlEw a little play for children called \" Christmas Ev ei the Forest,\" by jean T. Leavitt. It should hive' been said then that the play was based on, \"Thle Little Christimas Tree, \".by Susan Coolidge, and that the last haff is really an adaptation of that poem. Miss Leavitt and the Editor alike regret that owing to à misunderstanding, this explan- ation has been so long dlelayed. The play was arranged by Miss, Leavitt for ber- own pupils' with, at first, no thought ofits appearanèe in print. At the timne it did appear she was serious1y iii, and-did not know that due credit was flot giwen to the author of the poemn. We regret to record the death of Mns. R.. C.

If these men could 'be properly cared for thecir convalescence wol be hastened and the death rate mnuch reduced. These men are the best type of soldiers, as they are the seasoned veteran, and are of greater value than the new recruit. it was pointed out that France was doing lier best, but there was so iucli to, be done that she could flot overtake it ail. This made any forin of help) fromn other ceuntries very welcome. One of the urgent requrementa of the day was more nurses. There were hospitals with aainn as 500 cases and not a single trained nurse. This was duc to th fact that there were so manv 'wounded that there were flot a suf- ficiet nuiber of nurses te go round. Dr. Brow-n-Landene aaid that Britain wus doîng lier full ahare, but th de,,umds on hier vessels for the transportation of food te lier ewn troaps and the Belgians, and the eonveying home of the wounded were go npjmerous that she could net always forward nurses, ambulances and suple fo h hospitals.

TfRE question which one nmust face t the outset in the coxsid of thîs phase of the subject of to-niglit's discussion à: Wh medical treatment end, and surgical treatment begint A canvass of the opinion of the majority of surgeons activel, ing the results of this terrible malady, will ehiît the fact thati the cases are handed over to the surgeon too late for him to fulfil bisi chief functions, namely, the prevention of deforniity. F reason, the writer would urge that the cases of infantile paralysis receive surgical attention mucli earlier than is generally the ea would suggest that so soon as the temperature returns to normal pain lias disappeared, the case should be consignedl to the surgeonj time in most cases would be about the end of the third week, 1. One's lirst e:fforts should be directed to the pre8ervati, restoration of muscle function. How eau tuis be attainedt Massage here plays a very im] role. It is possible by systematic and thorougli massage to keep nutrition ini the muscles which are paralyzed, and stimulate any fibres which are active, to greater activity. This massage ispr doue by the parents because it must be continued over very long 1 If a masseuse is employed the apparent progress is so sliglit, eve long intervais, that the treatment will be discontinued. The resi negative ratiier than positive. One cannot sec very much inmpr under the. massage treatmnent, but if it is discontinued the baci are apparent. What the father and mother lack in seientifie n they wiUl probably make up in faithfulness. The masg should be started as soon as the pain ha dsa and should[ b. given twice daily for periods of thirty minutes hour-depending upon the. extent of the lesion. Mr. Robert jo Liverpool, some time ago pointcd out that a large nuxuber of y f ailed to regain their power, even after restcration of the. nere because they were permanently overstretched.

In paralysia of the tpper arin, the uiost important fuanction te recover is the abduc- tion, se oue devotes great attention te the possible restoration of the. (dettoid. it lias been demnonstrated that tliis muscle wvill recover its powver in mnuel shorter tinie if the armnÎ is eld abducted at riglit angles to tIse trnnik and a special, splint is made to, hold the arrn in. tlm8 position day and niglit. This apparatus is remnovable and the massage is earried on daily during its use. In paralysis of the lower extremity, the power of the quadriceps is the mnost important. This aise will recever most rapidly if the limb is neyer allowed te flex at the kuce, but la held in a complete1Y extendied pa it 101. The easiest niethod of keeping tlis position la by means of a caliper splint inade like a Thomnas kilee brace, or a double upriglit spliut reach- ing te the thigh Nvith ine joint at the kçnee. At niglit a trough splint s*iould be worn te keep the le.- extended. The writer has seen muscle restoration even after two years of apparent complete paralysis, by tuis constant relaxation. With an apparatus of this sort, the patient can walk, and besides being casier te care for, the writer feels certain that the efforts mnade to walk and use the muscles of locomotion bas a stiniulating effect on the nerve cela sand increases the possibilîty of their recovery. What may b. said about the mucli vaunited electrical treatient? Electricity la uinfortunately the dernier resort of many mnibers of the profeoeion, and it is used -usually by rule of thuxnb without any definite ,aethod in view; lience faradisin, galviniaxu sud static electricity are une indiscriminatelY. If we are to avoid the possibility of beiug claased with the chiarla- tans, 1vo must corne te somne clearer viewa on the subjec te! the. treat- ment of infantile paralysis by electricity. One kuows that in the builk of cases O! polionýii the muscles loe aIl response te faradisi within a fw weèks, aud hence it seems ahsolutely impossible te hope that one would get any benefit atter that by the use of faradie current.

Chienine water is first prepared by allowing two drams (8 granis) of concentrated hydrochioride acid to act on one drain (4 grains) of potassium chlorate i a dry 24 ounce (one litre) boutle. When the eolored gas reaches the neck of the bottie, the latter is tightly corked and the reaction allowed to continue for flfteen minutes, after whic wrater is gradually introduced and shaken with the gas, until the botl is fied. The treatment consists in giving the patient 30 grains (2 grams) )of potassium iodide in a half plut (250 c.c.) of water st breakfst tiine--7 a.m.-and four hours later, one ounce (30 c.c.) of el)iewater in a haif pint of lenionade.

Radical surgical treatmnent is out of place. For true coccy' godynis. medical treatmnent is only temporizing. There are two forms of surgical treatxnient. The, firat is excision of the coccyx. Most writers fromt Nott, whio performned the. first excision, on, testify to, the fflicacy, of this operation. 'Simpson advecated section of the muscle-insertions on the coccyx,' but this plan w118 d iscarded as being unsatisfactory. Whit ohead, Odell1, o! early writ - tru, and Fullerton, more recently, advocate the mecthod of excision. 1,,xcision w-ill probably cure every case of truc c-occygodyniia, if the( asswntiouthat the lesion is in the bone or the sacrococcygeal articula- tion be correct. It will not cure reflex or neuralgicenccygodynia. The operationi is extremely simple. A lineari incision is mlade over the coccyx and the end of the sacrum, and wvith ronigeuir and elevator the cocy.x is disjointed and peeled out. The only drawback te the epera- tion i,3 that the muscle insertions in the coccyx are of valueý te the j\u003eerineurn, se that the lms o! the Coccyx weakens that structure. The ether formn of surgical treatmient ia the in)jection of alcohel. De Vésian, in 1907, first uised this. iiethodl in an ohatinate case of reflex coccygodnia, getting the idea fromn the treatment of facial neuralgia by the. injection of alcohol. De Vésian 's case was that o! a woman o! 43. There was ne his- tory of injury te the coccyx, external or ohatetrical. There were in- flamznatery mnasses ln the pelvis, which De Vésian considered thi. cause oft the coccygodula. Operation was refused by the patient. Under local treatment the pelvie condition ameliorated, but the pain in the coccyx was still very seVere. After trying other forma of local treatment for the coccygodnla, De Vésian determined te try the injection of alcohol. Ile uaed 60 per cent. aiIcohl. Wlth the index finger o! the left hand in the rectum, thae needle was mnserted back o! thc rectum and anterior te the coccyx. At the dlepth o! 3 cm., 2 cec. o! alcohol were injectod along the sacre- cooygeai articulation and the needie withdrawn. Two cubîc centixuetera o! the alcohol were then injected along the poSterior surface of thc coccyx. But one injection was necessary and the relief was immediate.
