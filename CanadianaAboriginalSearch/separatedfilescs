         "J Preface It is more difficult to sell a good book by a new author than it is to sell a poor one by a popular author, because the good book by the new author must make its way against great odds. It must assert itself personally, and succeed by its own eflForts. The book by the popular author flies without wings, as it were. The one by the well-known author has a valuable asset in its creator; the one by the new author has no asset but its own merits. I am not contending by the above that this is a good book; far from it. Some books, however, hav- ing very little literary recommendation, may be in-teresting in other ways. There are several things instrumental in making for the success of a book: first, the fame of the author; second, the originality of the theme or style; third, the extent of the advertising scheme, and fourth, the proximity of the subject matter to the heart and home of the reader; and this last is the reason for the \" Skookum Chuck",

And to a man who measured everything bj worldly icties this was sound argument^ for the only big thing about Peter was his avoirdupois-barring his heart, of course. In the heat of his argument Johnny determined to de-prive Peter of his sacred property. And among the Indians this is not nearly so hazardous or ho^less or criminal an undertaking as it may seem thJmigh an Anglo-Saxon microscope. Although a wife is con-siderable of an asset to a white man, she is not so to an Indian ; and it may be to his advantage that he is more or less philosophical about it. The cultus Indian was at Lillooet when this skookum tumtum (good thought) occurred to him. He was cutting fire-wood with some of the Statlemulth (LiUooS .W i-'? r/!°'* *° ^^^ *^« ^\u003c'\"^d in his left defeat in battle.

Johnny's strong suit with his ancient flame was his personal icties; and when Peter was otherwise engaged he asked he girl to elope with him to Kamlc^ or going out with others on a cayuse hunt which",
         "had 20 SKOOKUM CHUCK FABLES been planned some time before. He invited Johnny because it would not be safe to leave him in posses-sion of the fort, and in charge of such a valuable, though fickle, asset ; for a great number of the Indian women are fickle. But Cultus Johnny declined the invitation. He was tired, and wanted to rest. Besides, ho had a bridle to finish which he was plaiting from the leather cut from the legs of an old pair of cow-boy boots which he had found; it would be worth ten dollars when finished. In spite of his good intentions Johnny spent the whole day in idleness at the home of Mrs. Peter; and, as it is no insult among the Indians for a buck to propose an elopement with his neighbor's wife, because it is a very common business transac-tion among them, Johnny again suggested the escap- *J?®*-. -^^^ ^°™*^ °\"^-^ laughed and seemed to enjoy the flirtation. But she would neither consent nor re-fuse. Hias Peter did not return that evening, and the next day Johnny was at the works with greater can-nonading, and with more skookum tumtum than ever, and this time he was braver. He was just on the point of putting his arm around the keeka's waist when the door opened and Peter darkened the open- vag. They looked at one another for a few moments like two panthers about to spring at each other's throats. Hias Peter had a hias gun, and he raised It to his shoulder and glanced in a very savage and threatening way along the barrel toward Cultus Johnny's heart. Johnny dropped to the floor and begged for mercy. Now it requires some courage",

Peter soon realized that his wife was eating at his table and living in another man's tumtum, but he kept on chewing his beans and bacon and dried soqiias (salmon) in silence, and, but for the intervention of Providence, Peter might have followed in the foot-steps of Paul Spintlum. One day Cultus Johnny and his sister went across the river to fish. They cast their nets directly across from the rancherie, beneath an angry-looking, hungry, threatening, overhanging gravel bed. He and his father and his father's fathers had fished there time out of memory. The old men of the village were squatted here and there weaving nets for the fishing season. Squaws were bringing in bundles of tree branches on their backs for firewood; others were scraping the flesh from raw deer-skins, stretched on frames which leaned against buildings. Some young fellows, among whom was Hias Peter, were rolling up driftwood from the river. Children were caper-ing about, laughing and shouting. Dogs were barking, cats mewing, roosters crowing. There wfis notL.'ng but joy, and peace, and harmony. It was just such a scene as may be witnessed on a bright sunny day at any Indian village in the dry-belt at any time. Sud-denly there was a rush and a roar and a plunge of waters. The whole mountain across from the ranch-erie had fallen into the river with one mad roar like thunder, and the water was thrown up upon the village and its helpless inmates. In a moment the peaceful scene was one of death and torture.",

         "Cul,„, Of the Booby Man Once upon a time in Ashcroft there lived a \"gink\" who was very much wrapped up in himself. At a local social function he took the prize one day for being the most unpopular man in the community; and this caused him to sit up nights, and study him-self as others saw him flitting across his unattractive and uneventful stage. The winning of this prize spoke to him with greater accent than could the ex-ploding of a sixteen-inch German gun, and it sent a quiver through his entire avoirdupois. It was not only an appalling revelation to him to know that he was unpopular, but it was a disgrace to his pedigree right back to the days of Samuel De Champlain, so he began to paw the bunch grass and seek revenge. JJirst he dug among the archives of history for a solu-tion. There must be some reason for this disgraceful blur on his life pages. Why was he the most un- popuiar man on these sand downs ? Why was he an mitcast? Why was he the Job of Ashcroft society? ^ow just why was he unpopular ? Had he boils, like Job? Was he an undesirable citizen? Was he a German, or an Austrian, or a Turk? Was he in-flicted with some loathsome disease? Was he a plague? Had some false reputation preceded him into the community? Had he a cantankerous dis-position? Was he repulsive in appearance? Was he",
         "24 OP THE BOOBY MAN 95 mean stingy? Was he stupid, ignorant, uneducated, brainless ? No, personallj he could not plead guilty of acquaintance with any of the above disqualifica-tions. Among the archives of his past Ashcroft his-tory he found some tell-tale manuscripts, the contents of which had never appealed to him until after the booby pme episode. In plain English, he found written facts which were as bold as the violation of iielgian neutrality. Incidents which had seemed very commonplace and unworthy of notice before, now loomed up on those pages and presented themselves to him as giants of the utmost importance. For instance, in lodcing up the records connected with the forminit of Ae Ashcroft Rinhs he found that he had not been consulted in the matter. His name was missing from tiiat interesting page of Ashcroft his-tory. However, when the time arrived for the form-ing of a company to finance the erection of the build-ing, great interest was taken in his bank account, and the promoters knocked very early one morning at his door seeking endorsement to purchase shares in the joint stock company which was about to be bom. At the meeting for the election of directors to take charge of the affairs of the company he was again surrounded by the same zero atmosphere. He was not even nominated as a prospective member.

Through the microscope he saw that present conditions could not be allowed to pre-vail. He was losing much valuable mineral over the dump. He was angry. The sensitiveness of his nature had received a shock ; he had been shown up as the most unpopular man in Ashcroft. It was time for him to have the mercury brought near to the fire. The next time prizes were being handed around his arm would be the longest, and his voice the loudest; and they would not be booby prizes neither. He had known men of a few weeks standing only, rise to the very apex of popularity, while he, with his ten years initiation, had not yet developed brains enough, in the Mtimation of the Ashcroft people, that would justify them in placing in his charge the managt;ment of the most trivial social aflfair.

He had discovered the result, but not the cause; so he began rooting among the sage brush of the sand downs for the foundation stone of his social submergence. \" I have it !\" he shouted one day. \" If one wishes to make a puncture in the aflFairs of this world one must assert himself; one must smite the table top with one's fist every morning before breakfast.

He neglected his own stamp- mill that the work might be carried out to a succesa- ful issue. He engaged others to take charge of the tail race and dump, with which he would not trust his brother on previous occasions. In fact, he left the steam of the mill at high pressure to look after itself that he might have an unhampered course in the asserting of himself. He invaded immediately all the dances carnivals, dinners and parties. He was both Liberal and Conservative in politics. He was the guy with the \" big mitt » and the vociferous vocabulaiy at all the local functions. He even joined the church.

The booby prize, after all, had been the foundation of his sticcess. So things went on and he became the most talked of man in the town. When any difficulty arose he was the first to be consulted. The town found it necessary to come to him for information on every local scheme that had its birth in the local cerebrum, for no one else was capable of handling any emergency and carry-ing it through to a successful conclusion. Just about this time the sewerage epidemic took possession of the town, and became an insane con-tagion. Meetings were held at various places to dis-cuss the matter, and at last the government agent allowed the court house to be used gratis for that purpose. Of course our hero and two other victims were appointed commissioners to investigate. His salary was the same as he received from his various secretaryships.

At initiative conclusions he would be classified with the freak species of humanity, but beneath his raw ex-terior there lurked rich mines which the moss kept a secret from the inquisitive, avaricious world. He owned and operated an extensive ranch from which he encouraged enough vegetation to feed him-self, his pigs, his horses, his cattle, his chickens, and his dog; and this, apparently, was all tjey derived from the great, green earth. But the asset side of our \"mossback's\" yearly balance sheet always made the liability sidei ashamed of itself. The asset increased annually, and the hidden treasure grew to alarming propor-tions. This growth was carefully salted away at the appropriate salting-down season, when the pork bar- rels were brought out of the dark cellars, dusted, scrubbed, and refilled with the carcasses of those animals which had been his companions for the ^ater part of a year. He was a standing joke with the hands\" on the ranch, for he was the most dilapidated of the whole gang, although the owner, and was reputed to be wealthy.",

When he first located on the homestead which had since become so valuable an asset, he had determined to live with one purpose in view, and that was to expand financially with the toil of his hands and the sweat of his brow, and then, when he had acquired sufficient sinking fund, to emerge suddenly into the limelight of society and shine like a newly polished gem. So he wandered up and down the trail which his own feet and the feet of his cayiise had worn through the woods, up the creek, along the face of the mountains, and away down to the limy waters of the Fraser on the other side of the perpetual snows. There was a fascination for him on this old trail; It had become as part of his life, of his very soul, bometimes he would be rounding up cattle. Some-times he would be hunting mowicL (deer), or driv-ing off the coyotes. All his plans and schemes were built on trail foundation. He could not think unless he was tramping the trail through the woods, and down the valleys. Here is where all his castles were constructed; and, from the trail observatory, he saw his new life spring into being, when the time would be ripe. In time the coin grew so bulky that it became a burden to him. It had grown very cumbersome.

To save buying boots he wore his last winter's overshoes away into the summer, while his feet would blister in discomfort. Braces were a luxury which he could not endure, so he supported his superfluously laundried overalls ^ith a strand of baling-rope which had already served its time as a halter guy. His feet had never known the luxury of a factory or home- knitted stocking since he had graduated from the home crib, but were put o£F with gunny sacking which had already seen active service as nose bags for the cayuses. \u003e \" If one wishes to acquire wealth in this world,\" he would say, \" one must make a great many per-sonal sacrifices.\" So he lived on and waxed wealthy at the expense even of the simplest of domestic com-forts. The improvements with which he had enhanced the value of his ranch were much in keeping with his personal appearance, and they could be recognized as brothers with the least difficulty. The fences, which had refused to retain their youth against the passing years, had their aged and feeble limbs supported with thongs and makeshifts of every description ; and where their pride had rebelled against such ingratitude, they were smothered beneath the limbs of fallen trees, which had been felled on the spot to serve as substitutes.

Here they would burst their sides with indignation, and had to be repaired. The bams, stables and chicken-houses had for years been threatening to collapse unless sup-plied with some stimulant; so numerous false-works had been erected, outside and in, to retain them within their confines. The harness, which had originally been made of leather, betrayed very little trace of this bovine enveloper, but was composed chiefly of baling-rope and wire which had been picked up at random on the ranch as the occasion demanded. The various sections of the wheels of his wagons re- mained in intimate association with each other be-cause they were submerged in the creek every night • tte moisture keeping the wood swelled to its greatest diameter. One day's exposure to the drouth, without the convenient assistance of the creek water, would have been sufficient to cause the wheels to fall asunder. In this respect the unsuspecting creek was an asset of incalculable value. Tue boxes of his wagons could boast of nothing up to date, that was not possessed by toe wheels; and in many cases the tongues and whiffletrees and neck-yokes had been substituted by raw maples or birch secured on the ranch.

He had his future to live for. He had his life all mapped out, and that was more than a great many could boast of.

They danced the \" tango \" and the \"bango,\" and the \"flango,\" and all the light fantastics \" until their feet went on strike, and their ear drums had become phonographic and reproduced the music with a perpetual motion which could not be stopped.

A message was sent to the Lillooet illihae (coun-try) with the glad tidings, and at the close of two days a swarm of smootlatches (women), and keeku (girls), rushed into camp breathless, and began hys-terically searching for their respective sweethearts or husbands among the prisoners. The scene was more than poetic ; and it was pathetic in the extreme. It was a scene that had not occurred before on the broad surface of the earth — ^those fifty distracted squaws rushing into the jaws of death in their eager-ness to rescue the ones without whom life would be empty, useless, aimless. It is said that it melted the heart of the very rocks about the place, so that to this day the surface of the earth at that spot betrays evidence of having at one time been running lava. The captives were lined up before the kookpi's kikwilly house, and the little army of love-mad squaws, awful in their primitiveness, rushed at the line, selected their respective skiuchs (men), and clung to them, hugged them, kissed them wildly in the awful heat of their passion, each in her eager-ness to save one at all hazards for her own selfish, but natural self.

Flossy and Freddy were float rocks. They had been picked up by Maud and Man-fred on their face value and welcomed to the family circle. They had been assayed at the provincial assay office and found to contain a valuable percent-age of real collateral; so our hero and heroine could not be reproached for taking them into their arms and allowing them the freedom of their home pas-tures. But, ahl this is where the evil one sneaJced on to the happy hearth-rug-they took the strangers into their arms. They were all young; and, more-over human. \\\\Tiat could they do when the failings of their ancestors of a million years took them inTn iron grip and led them in a hypnotic spell toward the bri^ of rum ? They were as helpless as the Liberals m B.C. politics m the year 1912. We have often quoted that every one must love one of the opposite sex at least once in a lifetime, and our herVand heroine were not immune from this stern gravitation law, because they were only human after all. What was the consequence? Maud fell hopelessly in love with ^red, and Manfred lost his conscience, his manhood, his heart, his soul, his brains, his job and his salary\" over the Flossy vision. They had fallen foul of a strong Conservative party, and civil war broke out Ihe former happy couple looked upon each other a^ intruders as disturbers of the peace. While before they could not get close enough, now they could not get far enough apart. Manfred would enjoy",

Ihe wife hated to see her husband come home at all, but she wont into hysterics when Fred arrived. When ^red and Flossy were away, or absent, goodness know, where, the once happy home was like a lunatic asylum, m which the mania with the inmates was a total disregard of each other, and where language was unknown. The husband and wife drifted f^Z and further apart They ceased to smile, ceased to know each other, ceased to see each other. They were like a lion and a tiger in the same cage. horrid prison. The children became detestable brats who were stumbling-blocks to their ambitions. French \" Cafe Maud had to purchase food and clothing from the local emporium with money she the Best\" Hotel. Finance became f reified, for Manfred spent both principal, interest and sinking fund on his affinity. Starvation and the cold world were staring them in the face, for the wolf and the collection man were howling at the door. The city cut off their light and water supply for non-payment of dues, and were about to seize the property for ar-rears; so they were on the water wagon and in dark-ness^ but sti 1 they would not regain consciousness.

         "Maud OF THE SWEET YOUNG THINGS 03 ignored Manfred's insane attitude towards Flossy be-cause she had the same love-blind sickness and could see no one but Fred. Far from being jealous, Man-fred viewed his wife in the light of « white man's burden which he could not shake off. Christian's burden was fiction beside it Flossy was the only star in his firmament— the only toad in his puddle. The children were neglected, and ran wild in the bush. It was as though some great Belgian calamity had overtaken the household and had riven it asunder. The garden lost its lustre, irrigation was discon-tinued, the fruit trees lost their leaves prematurely; the very willows wept. The pickets fell from the fence unheeded; the stovepipe smoked, and th«i chickens laid away in the neighbor's yard. The house assumed the appearance of a deserted sty. Divorce was suggested inwardly— that modem refuge to which the weak-minded flee in seeking a drastic cure for a temporary ailment; and all this disruption in two hearts which had tripped along together so smoothly and pleasantly. Surely love, misapplied, IS a curse. It is surely sometimes a severe form of insanity. If so, those two were insane, just waiting for the pressure to be removed from the brain. And theirs was a pitiful and unfruitful case indeed.

When any function took place the glad hand was extended to one and all. For every dollar poaaeaaed by one of the ladies' husbands the other husband had five. Mrs. Fivedollars waa very extravagant in her dress and domestic depart- ment, and Mrs. OnedoUar was very envious and am-bitious. The husband of the one dollar variety waa more or less of a henpeck because he could not mul- tiply his income by five and produce a concrete result It was a very predominating mania with Mrs. One- dollar to shine in society with as great a number of amperes as her rival; and this ambition gave rise to one of the greatest domestic civil wars that Aahcroft has even seen. Mrs. Five lollars had no envy. There rented by this mischievous goddess. She made no fjtr^ outfashion » fashion or to outshine her neighbors. What she displayed in dress did not ex- tend beyond the natural female instincts for attire. Uf course she had no cause to be envious, being by far yL^ fr?r^ ^\"^^^ ? *°^ ^'*^°»* \"^d\"« effort Mrs. Onedollar viewed the situation from a social apex, and the more she studied the situation the more she realized that the world waa discriminating",

Now, it came to pass that the husbands of those two ladies were the best of friends. They met frequently m he \"Best\" and \"Next Best\" hotels and drank healths m the most harmless and jolly manner. Thev often met at their places of business and exchanged Ideas. They had business relations with each other which terminated to the advantage of both. To quar-rel with each other, to them, was much the same as to quarrel with their bread and butter. They had ab-solutely no ambitions with regard to their personal appearance They had a suit of clothes each; when that was old or shabby they got another one. But. in this respect, man is very different from woman. All man wants is covering; a woman must have ornament and die must equal, if not outshine, her neighbor.' The tension between the two ladies became ^ater until 1 was almost at the breaking point. ^ Several attempts had been made by the distracted husbands o unscrew the strings which they knew were about to snap, but the result was nil. \" The vixen,\" said the one. \" The hussy,\" said the other; and when two ladies develop the habit of call-ing each other such queer pet names, a reconciliation seems very remote indeed.

         "™«eraftie Of the Ruse That Failed Once upon a time in Ashcroft there lived a lady who had the wool pulled over her husband's eyes to such an extent that he had optical illusions favorable to the darling\" who deceived him. His most allur-ing illusion was a booby idea that his \" pet \" waa an invalid, and she kept pouring oil on the joke to keep It burning, and pulled the wool down further and further so that hubby could not see the combustible fluid she was pouring into the flames. Her illness was one of those \"to be continued\" story kinds- better to-day, worse to-morrow— and she \" took \" to the blankets at the most annoying and inopportune moments; and every time she \"took\" an indisposi-tion she expected hubby to pull down the window curtains and go into mourning. But he, the hard-hearted man, would continue to eat and smoke and sleep as though no volcanic lava were threatening to submerge the old homestead. Hie sympathy was not enough ; he should stop eating, stop sleeping, and stop smoking- be should be in direct communication with the undertaker and negotiating about the price of caskets. His wife had the misleading conviction that when she was ill her case was more serious than that of anyone else.

Gradually hubby became convinced that his wifq was an invalid, and ho went into mourning as much as a man could mourn the loss of a joy that he had grasped for, and just missed in the grasping. He enjoyed the situation as much as a man could who had discovered that he had amalgamated himself with an hospital which was mortgaged for all It was worth to the family physician. Uut of his salary of seventy-five dollars per month sixty-five was devoted towards the financing of the doctor s time payments on his automobile; the balance paid for food, clothing, water, light, and fuel, and supplied the wolf with sufficient allowance to keep him from entering the parlor in the concrete. But the philosopher, as all men must ultimately become, concluded to make the best of his bad real estate in-vestment. He resigned himself to a life of perpetual, unaffected martyrdom. After all, it was his personal diplomacy that was at fault— he should not have bought a pig in an Ashcroft potato sack. During the first year of their matrimonial failure they had rooms at the \" Best » Hotel, and the girls carried breakfast to the bride's room seven mornings of every week at about 10.30, where the \"invalid\" devoured it with such greed and relish that they",

Their object was to bring home as many prizes and trophies as they could con-veniently carry without having to pav \"excess bag-gage, and donate the balance to charity. It was decided later not to take any of the prizes, as it was more blessed to give than to receive, and they did not only give away all the trophies, but they gave away all the games as well— games they had a legiti-mate mortgage on— and they were glad to see the other fellows happy. As a man often gets into trouble trying to keep out of It, so the Ashcroft chaps lost by trying to win ; and here it is consoling to know that all a man does or says in this world sinks and lies motionless in the silent past, for in this case it will onlv be a matter of time when people will cease to remember. But to leave all joking aside, we beg to advise that the adventurers were dumped unceremoniouslv into Mos-cow by the C.P.R. officials at about three good morn-ing and had not where to lay their heads.

         "i Of the Laws of Lycurgus Lycuboub reigned over a place caUed Lacedamon, which is a part of Greece, about the year 820 B.C. Kow, this is a great many years ago, and is further back into the archives of history than most of us can remember. There is no doubt, however, that this great ruler, Lycurgus, was crazy, or he was one of those persons whose brains cease to develop after they have left their teena. He certainly secures the first prize as a \" whim \" strategist In spite of his insane eccentricities, he was aUowed the full exercise of his freedom. Had he flourished in 1915 A.D. instead of 820 \" B.C.\" (which does not mean British Colum-bia), the asylum for the insane at New Westminster would not have been strong enough to retain him. Lycurgus did one redeeming thing— he founded a Senate;^ \"which, sharing,\"— we are following Plu-tarch—\" as Plato says, in the power of the kings, too imperious and unrestrained before, and having equal authority with them, was the means of keeping them within bounds of moderation, and highly contributed to the preservation of the State. The establishment of a Senate, an intermediate body, like baUast, kept It in just equilibrium, and put it in a safe posture: the twenty-eight senators adhering to the kings when-ever they saw the people too encroaching, and on the 133",
         "1.A lU SKOOKUAl CHUCK FA13LES IlilJl other hand, supporting the people, when the kiugii at-tempted to make themselves absolute/' Now, what in the world possessed this despotic imbecile to form a semite? His action in this can only be accoimted for in the light that it was one of those unpremeditated whims of a narrow-minded faddist. One naturally wonders what the newly created senators were doing while the king was im-posing his insane laws. This body was formed for the \" preservation of the state.\" The wonder is that there was any state left, for the king paralyzed com-merce, smothered ambition, choked art to death, and placed a ban on modesty. Further than having been \" formed,\" the \" Senate \" never again appears on the pages of the \" Lycurgus \" book. Plutarch, who lived in Greece about the year 100 A.D., nine hundred years after the subject of his biography, relates the forming and imposing of those laws with the utmost faith, and the most implicit innocence; which goes to prove that the Grecian idea of government, with all its knowledge, had not ad-vanced much, at least up to the time of Plutarch. And now for the laws. \"A second and bolder political enterprise of Ly-curgus was a new division of the lands. For he found a prodigious inequality; the city overcharged with many indigent persons, who had no land; and the wealth centred in the hands of the few. Deter-mined, therefore, to root out the evils of insolence, envy, avarice, and luxury, and those distempers of a state still more inveterate than fatal — I mean",
         "poverty OF THE LAWS OF Li'CUKGUS 135 and ricliea — he persuaded them to cancel all former divisions of land and to make new ones, in such a manner as they might be perfectly equal in their pos-sessions and way of living. His proposal was put in practice. \" After this he attempted to divide also the mov-ables, in order to take away all appearance of in-equality; but he soon perceived that they could not bear to have their goods taken directly from them, and therefore took another method, coimterworkiug their avarice by a stratagem.\" Now, this seems to be the only law to which they made objection; and this proves that the love of per-sonal \" icties \" has very deep roots. Perhaps the influence of the \" senate \" sustained them in this, for qualifications for a senator, even in those days, must have called for men of some means, and they, when the shoe began to pinch their own feet, would not care to divide up their sugar and flour with the rank and file. It does not appear, however, that they had any say in the matter, and, beyond the statement that they were formed for a purpose, they seem to have taken no part in the affairs of state; if they had, Lycurgus and his laws would never have been made part of history. \" First he stopped the currency of the gold and silver coin\" — thus he paralyzed industry — \"and ordered that they should make use of iron money only; then to a great quantity and weight of this he assigned but a small value. ...

This was the use of public tables, where all were to eat in conamon of the same meat, and such kinds of It as were appointed by law. At the same time they were forbidden to eat at home, or on ex-pensive couches and tables. . . . Another ordin-ance levelled against magnificence and expense, di-rected tha-t the ceilings of houses should be wroUt with no tool but the axe, and the doors with nothing but the saw. Indeed, no man could be so absurd as to bnng into a dwelling so homely and simple, bedsteads with silver feet, purple coverlets, or golden cups.\" Thus he smothered art and personal ambition, two of the most requisite essentials to a people on their onward Md upward trend to civilization and success. \" A third ordinance of Lycurgus was, that they should not often make war against the same enemy, lest, by being frequently put upon defending themselves, they too should become able warriors in their turn '' ene^es. ^^ '^''^^ ^^ defenceless against",

He wished, perhaps ignorantly, to arrest the progress of civilization and substitute a slovenly ideal of his own. His purpose was to cancel the civil-ization which the race had gained during thousands of years of effort, and bring it back to a semi-savagerv-. But the world was too big for him. It had things in view which were too great for his small, hampered mind to have any suspicion of.

         "practice. Of Joan of Arc Some people say the world ia getting no better, but if we take a dip into history and consider the con-ditions which prevailed tht re from the earliest times up to only a few hundred years ago, we will find a race of human beings which in no wise resemble the present output except in form and stature. And our own forefathers — the people of the British Isles, the Anglo-Saxons who are to-day leading in the social world — were not one iota better throughout those pages than many of the smallest and most unpreten-tious of obscure tribes living here and there in ignor-ant, local isolation. One of the strongest points in our argument is the fact that history, as we have it, is composed of the clang of battles and the private lives of kings and despots. The ordinary, everyday life of the peasant people — the working classes — ^the backbone of the nation, so to speak — was beneath the consideration of the historian throughout all times. The only virtue, in his estimation, was a strong arm — a large army to murder and destroy property. And the life of the historian must needs reflect that of the people. There is no doubt that in a great majority they were of a cruel, murderous nature. We get rare glimpses, however (at intervals of sometimes hun-dreds of years), of the doings, manners, and customs, likes and dislikes of the common people, that we can",
         "133 OF JOAlN' OF AKC 139 rely upon m autheutic ; the rest is poetry and legend, and, although typical, are relations of incidents that did not really occur. There ia no doubt that, aitlwugh it has been with-held, there wad a great deal of virtue, which blushed and bloomed unseen, amid all this blood and war. As though by accident the historian who immortal-ized Joan of Arc has let slip a few words in connec-tion with this heroine's earl^ life that are more valu-able to us than page upon page of some of our soKsalled history. *' Jeanne d'Arc was the child of a laborer of Domremy, a little village on the borders of Lorraine and Champagne. Just without the cottage where she was bom began the great woods of the Voeges, lere the children of Domremy drank in poetry and legend from fairy ring and haunted well, hung their flower garlands on the sacred trees and sang songs to the good people who might not drink of the fountain because of their sins. Jeanne loved the forest; its birds and beasts came lovingly to her at her childish call. But at home men saw nothing in her but ' a good girl,' simple and pleasant in her way, spinning and sewing by her mother'\", side while the other girls went to the fields— tender to the poor and sick.\" This is a little domestic scene of the year A.D. 1425, and how homelike and real and familiar it all is. What a sweet peace spot, among all the blood-shed and horror that was going on throughout France at ihat time. Joan of Arc is undoubtedly one of the most re-markable characters in all history. She was bom",
         "at 140 SKUOKUM CHUCK i'ABLES Domremy, JjVaace, in 1412, a*id was executed iu 14ai. Jiefore she had reached twenty this giri had practically Ireed i'rance from the iinglish, or at least put the country upon such a looting that a few years accomplished its freedem. The superstitions of the times are no doubt re-sponsible to a great extent for the success which was attained by this Maid of Orleans. \" The English believed in her supernatural mission as firmly as the French did, but thipy thought her a sorceress who had come to overthrow them by her enchantments,\" and so on. The fact remains that this innocent peasant g^rl of eighteen years of age freed France from the English and accomplished things which no man of France at that time was able to do. Either the French generalship of the times was very incompetent or the army was very much demoralized— at all events they had been awaiting the advent of a leader who was both determined and fearless, for skill does not seem to have been a requisite— and this appeared in the person of Joan of Arc. It is difficult to believe that an entirely inexperi-enced person of this kind could take charge of an army of ten thousand men and lead them to victory when the best trained generals of the time could do nothing and suffered defeat at every turn. With the coronation of the King the Maid felt that her errand was over. \" Oh, gentle king, the pleasure of God is done,\" she cried, as she flung her-self at the feet of Charles, and asked leave to go home. ' Would it were His good will,\" she pleaded with the",
         "-!! OF JOAN OF ARC 141 archbishop, as he forced her to remain, \" that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be glad to see me again.\" But the policy of the French court detained her. France was depending on one of its peasant girls for its very national existence. The humiliation of the thing should make all good Frenchmen blush with shame. So she fought on with the conviction that she was superfluous in the army, and a slave to the French court. It does not appear that she was even placed upon the payroll, or that she received reward of any kind for her services— and there were no \" Vic-toria crosses \" in those days. She fought on without pay; rendered all her services for nothing— perhaps for the love of the thing. During the defence of Com- piegne in May, 1430, she fell into the hands of one Vendome, who sold her to the Duke of Burgundy. Burgundy sold her to the English — ^her remuneration for her self-sacrificing, voluntarily-given services. And now comes the tragic part of a most pathetic story enacted out at a time when the name civiliza-tion, applied to the French and English, is a mockerv. \"In December she was' carried to Rouen, the head-quarters of the English, heavily fettered, and flung into a gloomy prison, and at length, arraigned before the spiritual tribunal of the Bishop of Beauvais, a wretched creature of the English, as a sorceress and a heretic, while the dastard she had crowned king left her to die.\" She was not even granted a legal, judicial",
         "trial. 142 SKOOKUM CHUCK FABLES Some say that her sentence was at one time com-muted to perpetual imprisonment, which proves that there was a glimmer of humanity hid away in some corner of the world, knocking hysterically in its im-prisonment for admission. \" But the English found a pretext to treat her as a criminal and condemned her to be burned.\" And at this juncture it may be well o say that we have good reason to be proud of oureelves to-day, and ashamed of our ancestors. She was brought to the stake on May 30th, 1431 The woman's tear* dried upon her chedcs, and she faced her doom with the triumphant courage of the w/lr-' ^.T'^J'^^ I««t awful momenta, as she left this world with the torture of the flames slowly consuming her body, what were the last impressions of ^ girl of mneteen who left home and happiness to ^ a Peop e who allowed her to be thus tormented to deatii ? A court was constituted by Pope Calix- tus III., in 1455, which declared her innocent and pronounced her trial unjust And through the whole civilized world her memory is fittingly commemor-ated in statuary and literature.\" But this is poor consolation and does not undo the mischief. So far as Joan of Arc is concerned, she is still burning, scorching, suffering at that stake, and the world and fte English are her torturers, still tormenting her, while the man she made king stands looking on in-differently heartlessly.

Half naked, he sprang out of bed, and saw, dimly, a crowd of savages bursting through the shattered door. With more valor than discretion he snatched a pistol that hung at the head of the bed, cooked it and snapped it at the breast of the foremost Indian. It missed fire. Amid the screams of his terrified children, three of the party seized him and boun^ him fast, for they came well provided with cords, as prisoners had a great market value. Nevertheless, in the first fury of their attack, they dragged to the door and murdered two of the children. They kept Williams shivering in his shirt for an hour, while a frightful uproar of yells, shrieks, and gunshots sounded from within. At length they permitted him, his wife, and five remaining children to dress themselves. After the entire village had been destroyed and the inhabitants either murdered or made captive, Williams and his wife and family were led from their burning house across the Connecticut River to the foot of the mountain, and the following day the march north began with the hundred or more prisoners.\" The hardships of the prisoners, and the crimes of the victors during that long and arduous march north through snow and ice, forms a chapter of pathos in the early history of those eastern states. \"At the mouth of the White River the party divided, and the Williams family were separated and carried off in various directions.

On one occasion he went him-self with the minister to St Louis. This time the Jeauits, whose authority within their mission seemed almost to override that of the Governor himself, yielded so far as to allow the father to see his daughter, on condition that he spoke to no other English prisoner. He spoke to her for an hour, ex-horting her never to forget her catechism, which she had learned by rote. The Governor and his wife afterwards did all in their power to procure her ran-som, but of no avail \" ' She is there still,' writes Williams two years later, ' and has forgotten to speak English.' WTiat grievjd him still more, Eunice had forgotten her catechism.\" But now we come to this strange trans- fonnation, unprecedented, we think, which made an Indian squaw out of a white woman. \"Eunice, reared among Indian children, learned their language and forgot her own ; she lived in a wigwam of the Caugh- nawagaa forgot her catechism, was baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, and in due time married an ijdian of the tribe, vrho henceforth called himself Williams.
