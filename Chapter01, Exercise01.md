# **Who Am I, Why Am I Here?**

### Hi There!
Hi, my name is Mitchell Deseure, I am majoring in political science and minoring in history at Carleton University. I hope to learn how to create an online space to share ideas and further my academic profile online. I would define myself politically as a socialist and hope that by learning about how to craft digital academics I am able to create new spaces for the expansion of political thought; specifically surrounding Canadian politics. There were not any options for digital academics in Political Science as far as I could find. I am very passionate about politics. I see the many flaws within politics that discourage people from participating. However, I am also from a small town that has been decimated by the outsourcing of jobs and the inability of governments to react to a changing technological world. My hometown has motivated me to pursue politics in order to provide Canadians the representation they deserve in some way or another. My dream is to be the mayor of my hometown because those are the people who provided for me as a child, coached my hockey, taught in my schools, worked all the jobs I would be lucky enough never have to. Those people cannot be forgotten and too often I feel like they are in modern politics.

### My Experience:
I hope to learn how to create an online space to share ideas and further my academic profile online. My experience with digital learning is really zero. I have taken several computer science classes. However, the idea of having a workable website to share ideas and interesting research on caught my attention. The only experience I would have in website crafting is my early childhood days on piczo and I had to create a webpage in Grade 9 Business; but it was not near as professional as this and obviously did not require any reading. I hope to be able to continue on after the course with my own online academic journal by using the skills I have learned.

### My Goals:
For this course, I hope to look into the treatment of Aboriginals in ***recent*** Canadian History. Often Canadians think of themselves as a leader in the world when it comes to peace, human rights, and sustainability. However, the treatment of Canadian Aboriginals is a blackmark on Canadian history that is not often discussed at length. My mother and aunt were both adopted and my aunt is of Aboriginal ancestry. I recently read a journal article last semester that highlighted the taking of Aboriginal children for forced adoption. Pregnant Aboriginal mothers were housed in homes much like those for unwed mothers and forced to give their children up for adoption. It was really the first time I realized my aunt's life could have been drastically different because of our treatment of Aboriginals. I also recently did a paper on the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords; up until which Aboriginals were largely ignored in major governing decisions. The twisting road that these accords drove down are very intriguing. But, the most intriguing is Elijah Harper and the realization the country did not just consist of French and English, it was in fact a much more woven multicultural nation. I would like to research the treatment of Aboriginals in recent history starting with Elijah Harper and continuing to present day in an attempt to find progress in policy and in Canadian attitude towards Aboriginals and their struggle for self-government and fair treatment.
