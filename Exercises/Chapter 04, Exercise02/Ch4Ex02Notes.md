#Notes:

##Questions:
How does it decide which words to group together in topics? Does it just run algorithms or something to compare words and phrases to *like features* or something? It is a bit confusing how I got the topics /"country land good years government made great year people money ...".

##Notes:
It is fairly simple to use, as long as the text is formatted properly I asusme this would work. Remember you have to do the things you learned in Ch.3 to get databases and cleaned text before you can group topics. Everything is a process, don't skip steps.

##Thoughts:
I'm hoping I can go furhter with this in some way to create more visualizations that I can put on my website. Can I make graphs somehow with these to show the importance of topics? I'm sure I can!
