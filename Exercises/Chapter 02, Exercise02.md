##Exercise 2 - Outwit Hub

##Download:
Downloading Outwit Hub posed no problems to me. It was a bit confusing trying to figure out what was actually the purpose of the exercise at first. I was a little confused at how the commands merely created a table that had the information that the person needs.

##Markers:
I eventually realized that by setting up the *markers* that are associated with the information we wanted allowed the Outwit Hub to sort out the unnecessary information. Outwit Hub will provide the user with a spreadsheet in order to be able to see the information they requested easier. 

##Completion:
I proceeded to follow the remaining steps and was able to create a table based on the exercise. I saved the table in my Research Notebook through github in the "Database Search" folder. Outwit not just only supplies us students with a handy tool to find information faster on numerous web pages. Outwit also lets the person know where to find such information within **the search** ("pie" on STOA). The table provides the user with the Adler type and number. Allowing the user to then revert back to the search and be able to find the information they actually need very quickly.
