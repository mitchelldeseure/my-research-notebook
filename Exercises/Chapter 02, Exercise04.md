###General Notes:
----------------
* Professor Graham has put a "/"module 2 finding data" on his github for all to work with and learn from; take advantage of it if the going gets tough for any data searching!

API: Application Programming Interfaces
* The text is more geared towards machines than humans
* Because we have the url's already, we can get the **oocihm** number from running programs as we did in exercise 3; you get access to every full item in the database 
* /X/ needs to be replaced by /oocihm.00000/ in the URL in order to get the full text of the document
