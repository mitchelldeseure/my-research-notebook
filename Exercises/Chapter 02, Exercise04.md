#Module 2:

##Exercise 4 - Tracking the Emphemeral Web

###General Notes:
----------------
* Professor Graham has put a "/"module 2 finding data" on his github for all to work with and learn from; take advantage of it if the going gets tough for any data searching!

API: Application Programming Interfaces
* The text is more geared towards machines than humans
* Because we have the url's already, we can get the **oocihm** number from running programs as we did in exercise 3; you get access to every full item in the database 
* /X/ needs to be replaced by /oocihm.00000/ in the URL in order to get the full text of the document

Outwit Hub
* Finds structure in web pages and grabs the info. you're looking for

Finding a Collection
* Everything has unique URL .org/details/[IDENTIFIER]
* An item does not have to share identifiers with it's collection
* Created a directory with terminal into my research notebook through github to hold the new collection from the BPLSCAS
* The search returned 9,770 results; was able to export so many into a directory called "/"Collections" and is located within the "/"my-research-notebook"



###Random Thoughts:
------------------
* I'm hoping there will be some fairly cool ways to extract all the info we are able to constantly accumulate.
