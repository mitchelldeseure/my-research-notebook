#Notes

##Questions:
To be honest, the only real questions I have about these exercises is why is this not a mandatory peice of university. These programs and shortcuts actually allow somehow to create research instead of just finding someone else's. It would add a lot to many of my course if I would have been able to combine even a bit of my own research to support stances on certain subjects instead of just mercilessly searching for articles that might support my theory. I could have been researching these theories my self and then finding the academic support to understand it. 

##Remember:
Reading everything available is important, without it certain peices of this would have been very difficult. 

The Standford NER is saved in your exercises folder for convenience.

##Thoughts:
Working with different text editors is kind of confusing, there have been numerous suggestions throughout the workbook. It might be useful to define if a texteditor is specific to the exercise or if the previous ones like **sublime** can be used.
