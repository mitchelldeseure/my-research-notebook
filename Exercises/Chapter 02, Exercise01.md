##[**Commonwealth Wargraves Commission**:](http://www.cwgc.org/)

###First Search:

Terms: 24th Kent Regiment

URL: [Search Results, 0 Records](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1)

###Second Search:

Search Terms: Kent Regiment, R.C.I.C.

URL: [Search Results, 11 Records](http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead.aspx?cpage=1)

I chose to search for my hometown regiment hoping to maybe uncover some information I did not know about one of my family members or friends families even. However, that did not happen. There were only 11 records with my search; a much broader outlook would be needed if researching for an actual content assignment.

##[**Epigraphic Database Heildelberg**:](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/home)

###First Photographic Database Search:

Search Terms: 

*Modern country* = **Belgium**

*Date* = 1800 - 1950

URL: [Search Results, 0 Records](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/suche?hd_nr=&land=be&fo_antik=&fo_modern=&literatur=&dat_jahr_a=1800&dat_jahr_e=1950&atext1=&bool=AND&atext2=&sort=hd_nr&anzahl=20)

###Second Photographic Database Search:

Search Terms: 

*Modern country* = **Belgium**

URL: [Search Results, 62 Records](http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/foto/suche?land=be&sort=land_sort_en)

My family is originally from Belgium and they came over during the Great Depression. I based my search for this database purely on their ancestry and the years they would have been living in Belgium.

**I will be storing the database files within My Research Notebook in its own "Database Searches" folder. Therefore, by organizing all my files together, I will be able to quickly locate any information needed.**
