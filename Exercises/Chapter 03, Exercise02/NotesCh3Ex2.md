##Notes for Module 3, Ex. 2

Seems fairly simple, by examining the steps each time and seeing what happened I was able to kind of use some trial and error methods for about ten minutes to search the text with different regexes and see what it would find, what it might replace with a certain regex.

After I saw that it wasn't what I wanted it to do I would just undo and try something new. The experimenting helped get a grasp on the program and see what regexes can actually do. It also showed me that mistakes are easily fixable in TextWrangler but it is always good to keep copies during certain steps. 

Overall, the exercise was fairly easy, follow the steps and you will be rewarded! :)
