#Module 2:

##Exercise 3 - APIs

###General Notes:
--------------
* The 'Canadiana Discovery Portal'; materials related to Canada's history, from a wide variety of sources; click for its [Canadiana Discovery's Search Page](http://search.canadiana.ca/)
* &fmt=json added to the end of a **URL** will create a webpage in which the data is organized for the machine, instead of the human
* 'retrieving individual item records' is only really possible with specific document numbers called **'oocihm'**; the only way to get those are to "write a program"
*

###Random Thoughts:
---------------
*"/"ap-ex-mac.sh" - I ended up just copying and pasting from Professor's github. I was not 100% sure what the course of action was to be with that exercise. However, I can understand the program a bit better now that I've read some other people's ideas of keeping a strictly script file around.
