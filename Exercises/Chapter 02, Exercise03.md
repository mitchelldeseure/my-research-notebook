#Module 2:

##Exercise 3 - APIs

###General Notes:
--------------
* The 'Canadiana Discovery Portal'; materials related to Canada's history, from a wide variety of sources; click for its [Canadiana Discovery's Search Page](http://search.canadiana.ca/)
* &fmt=json added to the end of a **URL** will create a webpage in which the data is organized for the machine, instead of the human
* 'retrieving individual item records' is only really possible with specific document numbers called **'oocihm'**; the only way to get those are to "write a program"
* The "/"curl" statements in ap-ex-mac have to have the URLs changed in order to run a search, not "/"curl" itself, but the URL that follows in the statement
* Pick key words carefully, maybe even run a quick search in order to get guidelines and what not right in changing the URL

###Random Thoughts:
---------------
* "/"ap-ex-mac.sh" - I ended up just copying and pasting from Professor's github. I was not 100% sure what the course of action was to be with that exercise. However, I can understand the program a bit better now that I've read some other people's ideas of keeping a strictly script file around.
* I understand now that the ap-ex-mac file is a template to search through **Canadiana Discovery's** digitized materials. I have the output.txt, cleanlist.txt, results.txt, and urlstograb.txt files on my desktop from the command prompts; the search seems to have been a success. 
* Note to self, Module 2 Exercise 3, if ever needing to revert back, remember to completely stop reading from Windows to until you have to split the output.txt file at the end.
* Was very confused trying to navigate through the textbook just during that part, so note to self, pay more attention to the task at hand.
